Showroom

A showroom is a large space used to display products or show entertainment.

A showroom is a large space used to display products for sale, such as automobiles, furniture, appliances, carpet or apparel. It is a retail store of a company in which products are on sale in a space created by their brand or company. A showroom can also be a space for wholesale buyers to view fashion merchandise for sale in their retail stores.

The world's most famous locations for a showroom, generally in the form of a cluster, are the Champs Elysees in Paris and Merchandise Mart in Chicago.

One of the world's largest showrooms is the BMW showroom in Abu Dhabi. The biggest collection of showrooms is a car showroom in Istanbul called Autopia Europia.

A showroom is a permanent enclosed space used to present a performance. Sometimes it is customized for a particular show; for example, the Las Vegas Hilton showroom used for the rock opera "Starlight Express" was customized by pouring concrete ramps onto its stage area and in the seating area.

Some showrooms are used daily, while others are only used when a performer is booked to perform. In some cases, a showroom is leased to a performer, who then retains all income rather than being paid by the showroom owner.

In fashion capitals such as New York City, Paris, Milan or London one can find temporary showrooms. 
These places can be rented on a daily or weekly basis. Some temporary showrooms are managed with the help of event management agencies. Temporary showrooms can also be pop-up stores, which are short-term sales spaces.

Automobile manufacturer Ferrari has recently introduced augmented reality technology into their showrooms, to provide customers with a more hands-on approach when purchasing a vehicle.
