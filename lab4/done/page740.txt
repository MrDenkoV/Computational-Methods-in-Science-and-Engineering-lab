Aminobacterium mobile

Aminobacterium mobile is a Gram-negative, anaerobic, mesophilic, non-spore-forming and motile bacterium from the genus of "Aminobacterium" which has been isolated from anaerobic lagoon from a dairy wastewater treatment plant in Colombia. Dissimilar to "Aminobacterium colombiense", Aminobacterium mobile has a marginally lower DNA GC-content (44 mol% vs 46 mol%.) "Aminobacterium mobile" is motile and ferments Serine to Acetate and Alanine. "Aminobacterium mobile" is both a Heterotroph and Asaccharolytic. Its adverse effects on both animals and humans are not yet known, but because of the ability of "Aminobacterium mobile" to degrade amino acids and peptides, the possibility of harmful effects cannot be excluded.
