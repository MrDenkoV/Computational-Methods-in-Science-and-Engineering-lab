Mathemagician

A mathemagician is a mathematician who is also a magician.

The name "mathemagician" was probably first applied to Martin Gardner, but has since been used to describe many mathematician/magicians, including Arthur T. Benjamin, Persi Diaconis, and Colm Mulcahy. Diaconis has suggested that the reason so many mathematicians are magicians is that "inventing a magic trick and inventing a theorem are very similar activities."

Mathemagician is a neologism, specifically a portmanteau, that combines mathematician and magician to suggest that mathematics is a kind of magic. A great number of self-working mentalism tricks rely on mathematical principles. Max Maven often utilizes this type of magic in his performance.

The Mathemagician is name of a character in the 1961 children's book "The Phantom Tollbooth". He is the ruler Digitopolis, the kingdom of mathematics.
