Piccoma

When the service was first launched, it offered a regular model of buying each individual manga and volume similar to other online shops but it has since moved to adopt the webtoon model where a user can purchase individual chapters and wait 24 hours to read some for free. Korean webtoons that are offered on Kakao's services (Daum Webtoon & KakaoPage) are offered through Piccoma in Japanese. Kakao Japan announced that it will start offering original Japanese, Korean, and Chinese webtoons for Piccoma in the summer of 2018.
