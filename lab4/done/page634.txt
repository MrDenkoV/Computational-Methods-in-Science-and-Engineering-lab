SCOBY

A SCOBY (or SCOBAY), short for "symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast", is a syntrophic mixed culture of bacteria and yeast used in production of several traditional foods and beverages.

The species comprising the mixed cultures vary from preparation to preparation, but generally include "Acetobacter" bacterial species, as well as various "Saccharomyces" and other yeast types.

Within a culture, anaerobic ethanol fermentation (by yeast), anaerobic organic acid fermentation (by bacteria), and aerobic ethanol oxidation to acetate (by bacteria) can all take place concurrently along an oxygen gradient. 

A gelatinous, cellulose-based biofilm called a "pellicle" forms at the air-liquid interface and is also sometimes referred to as a "scoby". Either samples of this pellicle or unpasteurized kombucha can be used similarly to mother of vinegar to begin fermentation in pasteurized sweet tea. 

Scoby cultures used in beverage production can produce a pancake-sized dish-like structure that looks somewhat like the top of a mushroom, hence its nickname "mushroom". It often forms in vinegar in jars of pickled foods.

Foods and beverages which require a similar "symbiotic culture" in their production include:

Queensland University of Technology and the State Library of Queensland have been using kombucha scoby to produce a workable bio-textile, called a "vegan leather".
