One-pass algorithm

In computing, a one-pass algorithm is a streaming algorithm which reads its input exactly once, in order, without unbounded buffering. A one-pass algorithm generally requires "O"("n") (see 'big O' notation) time and less than "O"("n") storage (typically "O"(1)), where "n" is the size of the input.

Basically one-pass algorithm operates as follows:

Given any list as an input:

Given a list of numbers:

Given a list of symbols from an alphabet of "k" symbols, given in advance.

Given any list as an input:

Given a list of numbers:
