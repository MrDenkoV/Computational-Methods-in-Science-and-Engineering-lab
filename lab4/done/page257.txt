Zassenhaus algorithm

In mathematics, the Zassenhaus algorithm
is a method to calculate a basis for the intersection and sum of two subspaces of a vector space.
It is named after Hans Zassenhaus, but no publication of this algorithm by him is known. It is used in computer algebra systems.

Let be a vector space and , two finite-dimensional subspaces of with the following spanning sets:
and
Finally, let formula_3 be linearly independent vectors so that formula_4 and formula_5 can be written as
and

The algorithm computes the base of the sum formula_8 and a base of the intersection formula_9.

The algorithm creates the following block matrix of size formula_10:

Using elementary row operations, this matrix is transformed to the row echelon form. Then, it has the following shape:
Here, formula_13 stands for arbitrary numbers, and the vectors 
formula_14 for every formula_15 and formula_16 for every formula_17 are nonzero.

Then formula_18 with
is a basis of formula_20
and formula_21 with
is a basis of formula_9.

First, we define formula_24 to be the projection to the first component.

Let
formula_25
Then formula_26 and
formula_27.

Also, formula_28 is the kernel of formula_29, the projection restricted to .
Therefore, formula_30.

The Zassenhaus Algorithm calculates a basis of . In the first columns of this matrix, there is a basis formula_31 of formula_20.

The rows of the form formula_33 (with formula_34) are obviously in formula_28. Because the matrix is in row echelon form, they are also linearly independent.
All rows which are different from zero (formula_36 and formula_33) are a basis of , so there are formula_38 such formula_39s. Therefore, the formula_39s form a basis of formula_9.

Consider the two subspaces formula_42 and formula_43 of the vector space formula_44.

Using the standard basis, we create the following matrix of dimension formula_45:

Using elementary row operations, we transform this matrix into the following matrix:

Therefore,
formula_49 is a basis of formula_20, and
formula_51 is a basis of formula_9.
