Giants in the Land

Giants in the Land is a children's picture book written by Diana Appelbaum and illustrated by Michael McCurdy. It was published by Houghton Mifflin in 1993.

The story tells of tall white pine trees, trees "that stood taller than an apartment house 25 stories high, taller than the tallest building ever built in New Hampshire or Maine. Giant pine trees that had grown in the New England woods for thousands of years." 

Michael McCurdy's black and white scratchboard illustrations give drama to the text.
