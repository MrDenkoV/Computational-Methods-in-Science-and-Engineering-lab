Hispanist

A Hispanist is a scholar specializing in Hispanic studies, that is Spanish language, literature, linguistics, history, or civilization by foreigners (i.e., non-Spaniards). It was used in an article by Miguel de Unamuno in 1908 referring to 'el hispanista italiano Farinelli', and was discussed at length for the U.S. by Hispanist Richard L. Kagan of Johns Hopkins University.

The work carried out by Hispanists includes translations of literature and they may specialize in certain genres, authors or historical periods of the Iberian Peninsula and Hispanic America.

Publications dealing specifically with Hispanic studies include the "Hispania" quarterly published by the American Association of Teachers of Spanish and Portuguese (AATSP). Richard L. Kagan has edited a volume on Hispanism in the United States and Hispanist historian J.H. Elliot has discussed it in his volume "History in the Making". 


The Spanish-language portal run by the Instituto Cervantes lists over 60 associations of Hispanists around the world, including the following:
