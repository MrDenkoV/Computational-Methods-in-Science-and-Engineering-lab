Tissue gas

Tissue gas is the name given to the action of the bacteria "Clostridium perfringens" (formerly known as "C. welchii") in dead bodies. Its effect on the deceased is that of an extremely accelerated decomposition. It is only halted by embalming the body using special additive chemicals. It most commonly occurs in the bodies of people who have died of gangrene, large decubitus ulcers, necrotising fasciitis or who have had soil, faeces or water forced into wounds.
