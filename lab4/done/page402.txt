Sialogogue

A sialogogue, sialagogue, ptysmagogue or ptyalagogue is a drug or substance that increases the flow rate of saliva.

Sialogogues can be used in the treatment of xerostomia (the subjective feeling of having a dry mouth), to stimulate any functioning salivary gland tissue to produce more saliva. Saliva has a bactericidal effect, so when low levels of it are secreted, the risk of caries increases. Not only this, but fungal infections such as oral candidosis also can be a consequence of low salivary flow rates. The buffer effect of saliva is also important, neutralising acids that cause tooth enamel demineralisation. The following are used in dentistry to treat xerostomia:


A tincture is prepared from the root of the pyrethrium (pyrethrum) or pellitory (a number of plants in the "Chrysanthemum" family). It is found growing in Levant and parts of Limerick and Clare in Ireland. The root powder was used as flavouring in tooth powders in the past.

Some of the pyrethrin extracts find use as relatively environmentally benign insecticides.
