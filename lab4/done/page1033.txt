Hermit kingdom

The term hermit kingdom is used to refer to any country, organization or society which willfully walls itself off, either metaphorically or physically, from the rest of the world. In the current geopolitical order, the East Asian country of North Korea is regarded as a prime example of a hermit kingdom, and the term is contemporarily used to describe that nation state.

Korea in the age of Joseon dynasty was the subject of the first use of the term, in William Elliot Griffis's 1882 book "Corea: The Hermit Nation", and Korea was frequently described as a hermit kingdom until 1905 when it became a protectorate of Japan. The term is still commonplace throughout Korea and it is often used by Koreans themselves to describe pre-modern Korea. 

Today, the term is often applied to North Korea in news and social media, and in 2009 it was used by United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
