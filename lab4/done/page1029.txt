Mountain research

Mountain research or "montology", traditionally also known as "orology" (from Greek "oros" ὄρος for 'mountain' and "logos" λόγος), is a field of research that regionally concentrates on the Earth's surface's part covered by mountain landscapes.

Different approaches have been developed to define "mountainous" areas. While some use an altitudinal difference of 300 m inside an area to define that zone as mountainous, others consider differences from 1000 m or more, depending on the areas' latitude. Additionally, some include steepness to define mountain regions, hence excluding high plateaus (e.g. the Andean Altiplano or the Tibetan Plateau), zones often seen to be mountainous. A more pragmatic but useful definition has been proposed by the Italian Statistics Office ISTAT, which classifies municipalities as mountainous


The United Nations Environmental Programme has produced a map of mountain areas worldwide using a combination of criteria, including regions with


In a broader sense, mountain research is considered any research "in" mountain regions: for instance disciplinary studies on Himalayan plants, Andean rocks, Alpine cities, or Carpathian people. It is comparable to research that concentrates on the Arctic and Antarctic (polar research) or coasts (coastal research).

In a narrower sense, mountain research focuses "on" mountain regions, their description and the explanation of the human-environment interaction in (positive) and the sustainable development of (normative) these areas. So-defined mountain research is situated at the nexus of natural sciences, social sciences and humanities. Drawing on Alexander von Humboldt's work in the Andean realm, mountain geography and ecology are considered core areas of study; nevertheless important contributions are coming from anthropology, geology, economics, history or spatial planning. In sum, a narrowly defined mountain research applies an interdisciplinary and integrative regional approach. Slaymaker summarizes:

Mountain research or "orology"—not to be confused with orography—, is sometimes denominated "montology". This term stems from Carl Troll's "mountain geoecology"—geoecology being Troll's English translation of the German "Landschaftsökologie"—and appeared at a meeting in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1977. Since then, scholars such as Jack D. Ives, Bruno Messerli and Robert E. Rhoades have claimed the development of montology as interdisciplinary mountain research. The term montology was included in the Oxford English Dictionary in 2002. It defines montology as:

On the one hand, the term "montology" received criticism due to the mix of Latin ("mōns", pl. "montēs") and Greek ("logos"). On the other hand, however, this is also the—well accepted—case in several, already established disciplines such as glaciology or sociology.

The following list includes peer-reviewed journals that have a focus on mountain research and are open to both the natural and the social sciences:
