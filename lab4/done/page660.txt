Consorms

A bacterial consorm or bacterial community is a group of different types of bacterial strains which cluster in a place, they shared might common food and help each other for defence by doing horizontal gene transfer - within a biomass - that summatively act as a unit, with each type of bacteria contributing to the function of the consorm (community).

This is a rarely used term that is mostly synonymous to consortium.
