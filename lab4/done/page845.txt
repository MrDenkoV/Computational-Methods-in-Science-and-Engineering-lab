Highbrow

Used colloquially as a noun or adjective, "highbrow" is synonymous with intellectual; as an adjective, it also means elite, and generally carries a connotation of high culture. The word draws its metonymy from the pseudoscience of phrenology, and was originally simply a physical descriptor.

"Highbrow" can be applied to music, implying most of the classical music tradition; to literature—i.e., literary fiction and poetry; to films in the arthouse line; and to comedy that requires significant understanding of analogies or references to appreciate. The term "highbrow" is considered by some (with corresponding labels as 'middlebrow' 'lowbrow') as discriminatory or overly selective; and "highbrow" is currently distanced from the writer by quotation marks: "We thus focus on the consumption of two generally recognised 'highbrow' genres—opera and classical". The first usage in print of "highbrow" was recorded in 1884. The term was popularized in 1902 by Will Irvin, a reporter for "The Sun", who adhered to the phrenological notion of more intelligent people having high foreheads.

The opposite of "highbrow" is "lowbrow", and between them is "middlebrow", describing culture that is neither high nor low; as a usage, "middlebrow" is derogatory, as in Virginia Woolf's unsent letter to the "New Statesman", written in the 1930s and published in "The Death of the Moth and Other Essays" (1942). According to the "Oxford English Dictionary", the word "middlebrow" first appeared in print in 1925, in "Punch": "The BBC claims to have discovered a new type—'the middlebrow'. It consists of people who are hoping that some day they will get used to the stuff that they ought to like". The term had previously appeared in hyphenated form in "The Nation", on 25 January 1912:
It was popularized by the American writer and poet Margaret Widdemer, whose essay "Message and Middlebrow" appeared in the "Review of Literature" in 1933. The three genres of fiction, as American readers approached them in the 1950s and as obscenity law differentially judged them, are the subject of Ruth Pirsig Wood, "Lolita in Peyton Place: Highbrow, Middlebrow, and Lowbrow Novels", 1995.

Prince Hamlet was considered by Virginia Woolf as a highbrow lacking orientation in the world once he had lost the lowbrow Ophelia with her grip on earthly realities: this, she thought, explained why in general highbrows "honour so wholeheartedly and depend so completely upon those who are called lowbrows".
