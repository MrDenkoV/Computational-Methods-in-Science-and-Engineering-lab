Gradec massacre

Gradec Massacre (Alb. "Masakra e Gradecit") was part of a series massacres of 150 Albanian civilians in the village of Gradec, near Tetova and Gostivar, committed by the Serbian army led by Nikola Jorgovanović, on November 15, 1915. Edith Durham stated that in the village of Gostivar the Serbian forces massacred entire populations and burned down whole villages. In the village of Gradec, 50 Albanians were bayoneted and similar events occurred in Reçan, Reç, Zdunje, Raven, Vërtok, Mirditë, Orqush, Simnicë, Banjicë, Kalisht, Çegran and Qafë. The massacres were committed by Chetnik commander Ilia Novoselo, Marko Angjeli, Miladin Boshuk and Risto Turcani. Atrocities had been begun in May 1915, where the Serbian forces harassed the Albanians living at the border. The Albanians of Reka were massacred by the Serbian Army in September 1915, and the houses were burned down and pillaged. The villages of Shtirovica, Tërnica, Strazimiri, and Reka were burned down and the inhabitants massacred. In the St. Jovan Bigori monastery in Shtirovica, Serb soldiers massacred 45 Albanians. The Serbian government then demanded that the Orthodox Albanians of Zhirovnica declare themselves as Serbs.
