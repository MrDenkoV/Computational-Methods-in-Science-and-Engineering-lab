Peter Hays Gries is the Lee Kai Hung Chair and founding Director of the Manchester China Institute at the University of Manchester, where he is also Professor of Chinese politics. He studies the political psychology of international affairs, with a focus on China and the United States.

Peter Gries was born in Singapore and grew up in Hong Kong, Washington, DC, Tokyo, and Beijing. He later earned bachelor's and master's degrees in Asian Studies at Middlebury and Michigan, and a PhD in politics from Berkeley. After a two-year postdoc at Ohio State, he was assistant professor of political science at the University of Colorado, Boulder for five years. He then spent eleven years at the University of Oklahoma, where he founded and directed the Institute for US-China Issues, and its two signature programs, the Newman Prize for Chinese Literature, and the US-China Diplomatic Dialogue.

Gries joined the University of Manchester as Professor of Chinese Politics in August 2017. After a fall of fundraising and a £5M donation endowing a new China Institute, in December 2017 he became the Lee Kai Hung Chair and founding Manchester China Institute Director. MCI promotes mutual understanding in UK-China relations. Its two signature programs are the UK-China International Photography Competition, and the UK-China Diplomatic Dialogue.

Gries studies the causes and consequences of how Chinese feel and think about the world—and of how the world feels and thinks about China. He is particularly interested in the causes and effects of mis/perception and mis/trust, with an eye towards the reduction of conflict.
