Musivisual language

In art, musivisual language is a semiotic system that is the synchronous union of music and image. The term was coined by Spanish composer Alejandro Román, and for over a century, has appeared in film and other media (television, video or multimedia). 

According to Román:

When film music and text connect, they produce meanings distinct from the separate elements. In this communication process, musical codes (melody, rhythm, harmony, sound, texture, form), in synchrony with the film (image, speech, noise...) interact. 

Román defines two levels for this language: "semiotic", i.e. the contribution of meaning of music over the image, and the specific "aesthetic" of film music, which means it has its own stylistic elements not belonging to other musical forms. These elements are determined by the cinematic form.
