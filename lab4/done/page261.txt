Jumble algorithm

Each clue in a Jumble word puzzle is a word that has been “jumbled” by permuting the letters of each word to make an anagram. A dictionary of such anagrams may be used to solve puzzles or verify that a jumbled word is unique when creating puzzles.

Algorithms have been designed to solve Jumbles, using a dictionary. Common algorithms work by printing all words that can be formed from a set of letters. The solver then chooses the right word.

First algorithm:


Second algorithm:


Algorithm to find the permutations of J:


J(1)J(2)

J(2)J(1)


J(1)J(2)J(3)

J(1)J(3)J(2)

J(3)J(1)J(2)

J(2)J(1)J(3)

J(2)J(3)J(1)

J(3)J(2)J(1)


Though the algorithm looks complex it is easy to program.

Douglas Hofstadter developed a program called Jumbo that tries to solve Jumble problems as a human mind would.
The program doesn't rely on a dictionary and doesn't try to find real English words, but rather words that could be English, exploiting a database of plausibilities for various combinations of letters.
Letters are combined non-deterministically, following a strategy inspired by chemical reactions and free associations.
