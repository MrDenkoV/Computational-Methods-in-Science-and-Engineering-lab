Champion Tree

Champion Tree is a designation afforded to selected trees that are special or superlative because of their size or significance. A number of countries including the UK, New Zealand, US and Canada support such designation schemes based on standardised criteria. A database of such designated trees in the UK is maintained at the "Tree Register".

The designations in the US are recorded in the National Register of Champion Trees.
