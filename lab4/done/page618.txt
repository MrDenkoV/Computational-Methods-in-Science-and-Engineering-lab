Flavodoxin

Flavodoxins are electron-transfer proteins. Flavodoxin is a bacterial protein that includes flavin mononucleotide. The structure of flavodoxin is characterized by a five-stranded parallel beta sheet, surrounded by alpha helices at either side of the sheet. They have been isolated from prokaryotes, cyanobacteria, and some eukaryotic algae.
