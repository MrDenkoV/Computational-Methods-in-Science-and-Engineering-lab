Trademark look

Trademark look or signature look is the characteristic clothes or other distinguishing signs used by a certain character or performer, making the person more recognizable by the audience. Politicians may also have trademark signs, such as the suit of American President Barack Obama or the Merkel-Raute hand gesture of German Chancellor Angela Merkel. It can also refer to the clothes of a certain subculture.

Some trademark signatures may have started as in-jokes, but have then come to have been recognised by a wider audience.

Sometimes, when a celebrity stops using a trademark look, people might even find it hard to recognise them.

The term trademark look (or anything similar) is not used in trademark law and a trademark look is not necessarily trademark protected in itself.
