Celebochoerus cagayanensis

Celebochoerus cagayanensis is an extinct species of suid in the genus "Celebochoerus". The first fossil specimen was discovered in 2016 in the Philippines. It differs from the Sulawesi species "Celebochoerus heekereni" in that it has mesial and distal enamel bands on its upper canines. It also has huge upper tusks. The animal's features are symplesiomorphic in suids, indicating a Philippines to Sulawesi migration route. They can be viewed at the National Museum of the Philippines.
