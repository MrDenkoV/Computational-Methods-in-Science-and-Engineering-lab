Me-too compound

A me-too compound or follow-on drug is a drug product that contains an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) that is chemically related, and usually very structurally similar, to a known active pharmaceutical ingredient. The me-too may differ in some respects from the prototype drug (e.g. side effect profile or activity), but uses the same mechanism and is used for the same purpose as the original. 

The term follows from the phrase "me too" and is usually used in a negative way, the idea being the me-too drug simply rode the coattails of the research and development done to develop the prototype API. Me-too drugs can be novel compounds themselves, and drug products containing them can serve as market competition, driving prices down; similarly active compounds are exhibited soon after a novel API is made available.
