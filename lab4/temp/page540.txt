It has been described as "Spring from the Mother Nature, Exceed the Mother Nature” (Traditional Chinese: 源於自然，超於自然): This style is noted for an emphasis on the match between "the natural" and "the artificial" parts of the bonsai. For instance, artists of Lingnan penjing tend to spend much time choosing a pot that matches that plants. Furthermore, it explicitly focuses on "inner beauty" - Lingnan penjing artists always pay attention to the penjing's has its own unique ambiance and mood. When viewing a Lingnan penjing, a viewer is expected to savor the messages and emotions behind the penjing work.

Lingnan penjing artists generally prune their trees with the “Grow and Clip” method. Instead of using wires to bend them, the branches keep being clipped as they grow. Every clip creates a new twist and a new session on the said branch, and in every session grows new branches. At last, as the tree keeps growing and being pruned in this way, it will taper from the base to apex. The result is that the proportions between the trunk and branches will be highly developed, with branches full of turns and twists.
