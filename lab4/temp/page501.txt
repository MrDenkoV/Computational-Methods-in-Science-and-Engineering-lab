Broad-leaved tree

A broad-leaved, broad-leaf, or broadleaf tree is any tree within the diverse botanical group of angiosperms which has flat leaves and produces seeds inside of fruits. It is one of two general types of trees; the other type is a conifer, a tree with needle-like or scale-like leaves and seeds borne in woody cones. Broad-leaved trees are sometimes known as hardwoods.

Most deciduous trees are broad-leaved.
