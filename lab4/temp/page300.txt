Abramov's algorithm

In mathematics, particularly in computer algebra, Abramov's algorithm computes all rational solutions of a linear recurrence equation with polynomial coefficients. The algorithm was published by Sergei A. Abramov in 1989. 

The main concept in Abramov's algorithm is a universal denominator. Let formula_1 be a field of characteristic zero. The "dispersion" formula_2 of two polynomials formula_3 is defined asformula_4where formula_5 denotes the set of non-negative integers. Therefore the dispersion is the maximum formula_6 such that the polynomial formula_7 and the formula_8-times shifted polynomial formula_9 have a common factor. It is formula_10 if such a formula_8 does not exist. The dispersion can be computed as the largest non-negative integer root of the resultant formula_12. Let formula_13 be a recurrence equation of order formula_14 with polynomial coefficients formula_15, polynomial right-hand side formula_16 and rational sequence solution formula_17. It is possible to write formula_18 for two relatively prime polynomials formula_3. Let formula_20 andformula_21where formula_22 denotes the falling factorial of a function. Then formula_23 divides formula_24. So the polynomial formula_24 can be used as a denominator for all rational solutions formula_26 and hence it is called a universal denominator.

Let again formula_13 be a recurrence equation with polynomial coefficients and formula_24 a universal denominator. After substituting formula_29 for an unknown polynomial formula_30 and setting formula_31 the recurrence equation is equivalent toformula_32As the formula_33 cancel this is a linear recurrence equation with polynomial coefficients which can be solved for an unknown polynomial solution formula_34. There are algorithms to find polynomial solutions. The solutions for formula_34 can then be used again to compute the rational solutions formula_36. 

The homogeneous recurrence equation of order formula_46formula_47over formula_48 has a rational solution. It can be computed by considering the dispersionformula_49This yields the following universal denominator:formula_50andformula_51Multiplying the original recurrence equation with formula_52 and substituting formula_53 leads toformula_54This equation has the polynomial solution formula_55 for an arbitrary constant formula_56. Using formula_57 the general rational solution isformula_58for arbitrary formula_56.
