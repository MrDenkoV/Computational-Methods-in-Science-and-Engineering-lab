Forcing a safeguard

Forcing a safeguard is a war crime of violating a safeguard, which is an order to protect a property, locations or persons obtained from the enemy or neutral parties, or a guard or guard detachment to enforce this protection. In the United States, forcing a safeguard is punishable by death per Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ).

A safeguard is often placed by a commanding officer in order to prevent looting, pillaging or wanton destruction of enemy property, or to prevent unauthorized requisitioning of goods. The commanding officer can often spare only an individual soldier or a small detachment to enforce the safeguard. Overpowering the guard(s) to loot the goods constitutes forcing a safeguard. Another type of safeguard is a written order left with the enemy or his property, with the intent to protect surrendered enemies from further violence. By placing the safeguard, the officer pledges the honor of his military to protect its target. Thus, violation of the safeguard by personnel from the same military jeopardizes the reputation of the entire country and its military.
