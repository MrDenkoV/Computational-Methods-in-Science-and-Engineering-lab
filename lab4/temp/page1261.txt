Republican guard

A republican guard, sometimes called a national guard, is a state organization of a country (often a republic) which typically serves to protect the head of state and the government, and thus is often synonymous with a presidential guard. The term is derived from the original French Gendarmerie unit. Several other countries also have adopted the term and have active guard units.
