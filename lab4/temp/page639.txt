Coccobacillus

A coccobacillus (plural coccobacilli) is a type of bacterium with a shape intermediate between cocci (spherical bacteria) and bacilli (rod-shaped bacteria). Coccobacilli, then, are very short rods which may be mistaken for cocci.

"Haemophilus influenzae", "Gardnerella vaginalis", and "Chlamydia trachomatis" are coccobacilli. "Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans" is a Gram-negative coccobacillus prevalent in subgingival plaques. "Acinetobacter" strains may grow on solid media as coccobacilli. "Bordetella pertussis" is a Gram-negative coccobacillus responsible for causing whooping cough. "Yersinia pestis", the bacteria that causes plague, is also coccobacillus.

"Coxiella burnetti" is also a coccobacillus. Bacteria from the genus "Brucella" are medically important coccobacilli that cause brucellosis. "Haemophilus ducreyi", another medically important Gram-negative coccobacillus, is observed in sexually transmitted disease, chancroid, of Third World countries.
