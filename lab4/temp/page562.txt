Tree Ambulance

Tree Ambulance is an initiative that was launched on the occasion of International Day for Biological Diversity on May 22, 2019, by the Vice President of India, Venkaiah Naidu. A brainchild of Chennai-based environmentalist K Abdul Ghani, also known as the “"Green Man of India”", it has been started with the purpose of providing care to trees and to increase the green cover.

The initiative was launched for the purpose of providing a platform to battle Climate Change by replanting the uprooted trees due to Cyclone Vardah and Cyclone Gaja that struck South India in November 2018. Tree Ambulance is also tasked to provide other services such as seed bank, plant distribution and campaigns to plant more trees and even removal of dead trees. To provide better services, Tree Ambulance will also be accompanied by plant experts and volunteers who can work on providing different services to bring the trees back on their feet.

Tree Ambulance is also tasked to visit schools and institutions to educate people on the importance of trees and increasing the green cover.
