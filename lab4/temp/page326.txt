Sliding DFT

The sliding DFT is a recursive algorithm to compute
successive STFTs of input data frames that are a single sample
apart (hopsize-1).

Starting with a DFT at time n,

formula_1

The DFT for time n+1 can be computed as

formula_2

and recursively thereafter as

formula_3

with

formula_4
