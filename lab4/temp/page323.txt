Behavior selection algorithm

In artificial intelligence, a behavior selection algorithm, or action selection algorithm, is an algorithm that selects appropriate behaviors or actions for one or more intelligent agents. In game artificial intelligence, it selects behaviors or actions for one or more non-player characters. Common behavior selection algorithms include:


In application programming, run-time selection of the behavior of a specific method is referred to as the strategy design pattern.
