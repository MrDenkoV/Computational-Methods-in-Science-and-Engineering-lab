Olympic oaks

The Olympic oaks or, informally, Hitler oaks are the English oak trees grown from the year-old saplings given to the gold medal winners of the 1936 Olympic Games, in Berlin, which was seen as Adolf Hitler's games. They were called "Olympic oaks" at the time. Not many are known, and fewer have survived. Not all of the trees, if any, were presented by Hitler, Lovelock's for example, being presented by Dr Theodor Lewald, and Boardman's being collected by members of his crew. 130 gold medals were awarded, and a corresponding number of trees.

While the largest number of oaks was given to German athletes, who won the most medals, many are said to be planted near the stadium, though no record was kept, and they would be difficult to identify among the many oaks in the vicinity.
