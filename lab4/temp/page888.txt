Enea Tree Museum

The Enea Tree Museum is a 75,000 m² park near Lake Zurich in Rapperswil-Jona, Canton of St. Gallen, Switzerland. The tree museum shows over 50 trees from over 25 species as well as sculptures by international artists.

The tree museum, founded in 2010, was planned and built by landscape architect Enzo Enea. The property at Lake Zürich was leased from the Mariazell-Wurmsbach Cistercian Abbey. Before the construction, water had to be extracted from the former wetland. For this purpose, an avenue of swamp cypresses was set up. This tree species naturally extracts a lot of water from the soil (evapotranspiration). Today this avenue forms the entrance to the tree museum. The museum has been open to the public since it opened.

The trees growing in the tree museum should have been felled, but were rescued by Enea and replanted in the tree museum. The following specimens belong to the tree population:
Sculptures by international artists can be found in the tree museum. The following works of art are curated in the Tree Museum:
