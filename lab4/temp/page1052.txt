Earth section paths

Earth section paths are paths on the earth defined by the intersection of a reference ellipsoid and a plane. Common examples of earth sections include the great ellipse and normal sections. This page provides a unifying approach to all earth sections and their associated geodetic problems.

The indirect problem for earth sections is: given two points, formula_1 and formula_2 on the surface of the reference ellipsoid, find the length, formula_3, of the short arc of a spheroid section from formula_1 to formula_2 and also find the departure and arrival (true north referenced) azimuths of that curve, formula_6 and formula_7. Let formula_8 have geodetic latitude formula_9 and longitude formula_10 (k=1,2). This problem is best solved using analytic geometry in ECEF coordinates.
Let formula_11 and formula_12 be the ECEF coordinates of the two points, computed using the geodetic to ECEF transformations discussed here.

To define the section plane select any third point formula_13 not on the line from formula_14 to formula_15. Choosing formula_13 to be on the surface normal at formula_1 will define the normal section at formula_1. If formula_13 is the origin then the earth section is the great ellipse. (The origin would be co-linear with 2 antipodal points so a different point must be used in that case). Since there are infinitely many choices for formula_13, the above problem is really a class of problems (one for each plane). Let formula_13 be given. To put the equation of the plane into the standard form, formula_22, where formula_23, requires the components of a unit vector, formula_24, normal to the section plane. These components may be computed as follows: The vector from formula_13 to formula_14 has components formula_27, and the vector from formula_14 to formula_15 has components formula_30. Therefore, formula_31 = formula_32×formula_33), where formula_34 is the unit vector in the direction of formula_35. The orientation convention used here is that formula_31 points to the left of the path. If this is not the case then redefine formula_37 = -formula_37. Finally, the parameter d for the plane may be computed using the dot product of formula_31 with a vector from the origin to any point on the plane, such as formula_14, i.e. d = formula_41. The equation of the plane (in vector form) is thus formula_31 ⋅ formula_43 = d, where formula_43 is the position vector of (x, y, z).

Examination of the ENU to ECEF transformation reveals that the ECEF coordinates of a unit vector pointing east at any point on the ellipsoid is: formula_45=formula_46, a unit vector pointing north is formula_47=formula_48, and a unit vector pointing up is formula_49=formula_50. A vector tangent to the path is:
formula_51 so the east component of formula_52 is formula_53, and the north component is formula_54. Therefore, the azimuth may be obtained from a two-argument arctangent function, formula_55=formula_56. Use this method at both formula_1 and formula_2 to get formula_6 and formula_7.

The (non-trivial) intersection of a plane and ellipsoid is an ellipse. Therefore, the arc length, formula_3, on the section path from formula_1 to formula_2 is an elliptic integral that may be computed to any desired accuracy using a truncated series. Before this can be done the ellipse must be defined and the limits of integration computed.
Let the ellipsoid given by formula_64, and let formula_65.
If p=0 then the section is a horizontal circle of radius formula_66, which has no solution if formula_67.

If p>0 then Gilbertson showed that the ECEF coordinates of the center of the ellipse is formula_68, where formula_69,

the semi-major axis is formula_70, in the direction formula_71, and
the semi-minor axis is formula_72, in the direction formula_73, which has no solution if formula_74.

The polar form relative to center for the equation of an ellipse is formula_75, where formula_76, relates to the ellipse eccentricity, not the spheroid eccentricity (see ellipse). Let P be a point on the ellipse and formula_77, then the vector from formula_78 to formula_43 has components formula_80. Using an argument similar to the one for azimuth above, let formula_81, then formula_82, and formula_83, and formula_84. In this way we obtain the central angles formula_85 and formula_86 corresponding to formula_1 and formula_2 respectively. Care must be taken to ensure that formula_89 ≤ formula_90 ≤ formula_91. Then the arc length along the ellipse is given by formula_3 =formula_93 Substituting formula_94 above into this formula, performing the indicated operations, using one more term than Gilbertson's expression and regrouping, results in 
formula_95, where
Alternatively, expansions for the Meridian arc may be used here by replacing the spheroid eccentricity with the section ellipse eccentricity.

The direct problem is given formula_97, the distance, formula_98, and departure azimuth, formula_6, find formula_100 and the arrival azimuth, formula_7.

Construct the tangent vector at formula_97, formula_103, where formula_104 and formula_105 are unit vectors pointing north and east (respectively) at formula_97. Pick a vector, formula_37, to define the section plane, paying attention to orientation. Observe that formula_37 must not be in span{formula_109} (otherwise the plane would be tangent to the earth at formula_97, so no path would result). The normal vector formula_31 = formula_32×formula_113), together with formula_97 defines the plane.

This is a 2-d problem in span{formula_116}, which will be solved with the help of the arc length formula above. The basic approach is to use Newton-Raphson iteration to arrive at formula_100. The basis of the estimate is that the position vector of any point on the section ellipse may be expressed in terms of the position vector of the center and the central angle as 
formula_118.
To get an initial estimate of formula_119, let formula_120, formula_121=Central_Angleformula_122 (see the arc length section above),
formula_123, formula_124.

Now initialize formula_125 = formula_126, and iterate the following steps:
exit when formula_128

No more than three iterations are usually necessary, although nearly antipodal cases can be problematic.
Finally, let formula_129, and formula_100 = ECEF_to_Geoformula_131 using Bowring's 1985 algorithm, or the algorithm here.

Alternatively, inversion of the arc length series may be used to avoid iterations.

Azimuth may be obtained by the same method as the indirect problem: formula_132=formula_133, where the subscript 2 indicates evaluation of the associated quantity at formula_2.

Let formula_13 be the origin, so that formula_136 = the position vector of formula_14. The above approach provides an alternative to that of others, such as Bowring.

The normal section at formula_1 is determined by letting formula_136 = formula_140 (the surface normal at formula_1). The above approach provides an alternative to that of others, such as Bowring.

The mean normal section from formula_1 to formula_2 is determined by letting formula_136 = formula_145. This is a good approximation to the geodesic from formula_1 to formula_2 for aviation or sailing.

A class of sections may be imagined by rotating formula_140 about the chord connecting formula_1 and formula_150 All of these may be solved with the single approach above.

Let two section planes be given: formula_151⋅formula_43 = formula_153, and formula_154⋅formula_43 = formula_156. Assuming that the two planes are not parallel, the line of intersection is on both planes. Hence orthogonal to both normals, i.e. in the direction of formula_157.

Since formula_151 and formula_154 are not colinear formula_151, formula_154, formula_162 is a basis for formula_163. Therefore, there exist constants formula_164 and formula_165 such that the line of intersection of the 2 planes is given by formula_43 = formula_167 + formula_168 + tformula_162, where t is an independent parameter.

Since this line is on both section planes, it satisfies both: 
formula_164 + formula_165(formula_151·formula_154) = formula_153, and 
formula_164(formula_151·formula_154) + formula_165 = formula_156.

Solving these equations for formula_180 and formula_181 gives 
formula_164 [1 - (formula_183 ] = formula_153 - formula_156(formula_151·formula_154), and 
formula_165 [1 - (formula_183 ] = formula_156 - formula_153(formula_151·formula_154).

Define the "dihedral angle", formula_55, by formula_195 = formula_196·formula_197.
Then formula_164 = formula_199 , and formula_165 = formula_201.

On the intersection line we have formula_43 = formula_13 + tformula_162, where formula_13 = formula_167 + formula_168.
Hence: formula_208 = formula_209 + tformula_210, formula_211 = formula_212 + tformula_213, and formula_214 = formula_215 + tformula_216, where
formula_209= formula_218 + formula_219, formula_212 = formula_221 + formula_222, and formula_215 = formula_224 +formula_225.
and formula_226=(formula_227,formula_228,formula_229), for i=1,2,3.

To find the intersection of this line with the earth, plug the line equations into formula_64, to get
formula_231, where formula_232 = formula_233, 
formula_234 = formula_235,
formula_236 = formula_237.

Therefore, the line intersects the earth at formula_238. If formula_239, then there is no intersection. If formula_240, then the line is tangent to the earth at formula_241 (i.e. the sections intersect at that single point).

Observe that formula_242 since formula_151 and formula_154are not colinear. Plugging t into
formula_43 = formula_13 + tformula_162, gives the points of intersection of the earth sections.

on an earth section path may be found by dropping the subscripts on the given section; formula_248, formula_249, and setting formula_250, so that formula_251. Then solve for formula_252 such that formula_240.

Since formula_254, and formula_255, we must have formula_256. Plugging t into formula_43 = formula_258, gives the points of intersection of the earth sections. Alternatively, just set formula_259.

on an earth section path may be found by dropping the subscripts on the given section; formula_248, formula_249, and setting formula_262, where formula_263 is the longitude to be solved for such that formula_240.

Alternatively, just set formula_265.
