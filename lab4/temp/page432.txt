Pancrinol

Pancrinol was a medicine made from liver, spleen, kidney and adrenal extracts from slaughter animals.

It was manufactured by the laboratories of Dr. Fran√ßois Debat in Paris. This drug was presented, in drinkable ampoules, as a tonic against anemia, tuberculosis and all organic deficiencies.

Some cyclists took it.
