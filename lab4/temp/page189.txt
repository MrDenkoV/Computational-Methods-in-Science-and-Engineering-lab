The co-editor of the journal is Professor and Dean of Arts Hanna Snellman at the University of Helsinki, the associate editor is Dr. Scott Kaukonen at Sam Houston State University, and the assistant editor is Dr. Hilary Virtanen at Finlandia University. Dr. Sheila Embleton from York University serves as the book review editor. The editorial board includes prominent academics both in Finland and internationally. 

The mission of the "Journal of Finnish Studies" is to publish scholarly articles about topics related to Finland and the Finnish diaspora for the international, English-speaking audience. Each volume includes two issues, and the journal also publishes guest-edited theme issues from time to time.
