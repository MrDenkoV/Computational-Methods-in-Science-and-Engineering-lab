Back to nature

Back to nature or return to nature is a philosophy or style of living which emphasises closeness to nature, rather than artifice and civilisation. In this, the rustic customs and pastoralism of country life are preferred to urban fashion and sophistication. A famous example is Henry David Thoreau who spent two years living a simple life in a log cabin at Walden Pond.
