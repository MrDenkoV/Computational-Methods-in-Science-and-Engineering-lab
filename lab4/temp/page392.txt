Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach Foundation

The Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach Foundation () is a major German philanthropic foundation, created by and named in honour of Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach, a convicted criminal against humanity, and the former owner and head of the Krupp company. Once it was the largest company in Europe, and one of largest wartime users of slave labor in Nazi Germany, including the Krupp munitions factory ("Weichsel Union Metallwerke") in the Auschwitz death camp. In 1959, the company promised to pay individual compensations of DM5,000 ($1,190) to 2,000 slave workers (or 2% of all the estimated estimated 100,000 slave workers), or DM10,000,000 ($2,380,000) in total.

On the death of Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach in 1967, the entire holdings of the Krupp family were transferred to the foundation. Today, the foundation is the largest shareholder of the ThyssenKrupp industrial conglomerate (20.9% as of 2018) and largely controls the board of the company. The foundation is also tasked with preserving the “unity” of ThyssenKrupp and uses proceeds from ThyssenKrupp’s dividend payments to further good causes in science and education. In the 2018 money, the aforementioned 1959 compensation payouts equate to $20,537,000, that is, €18,401,000. The sum is 0.02 percent of ThysenKrupp's 2018 assets, net income and equity, or over €72billion.
