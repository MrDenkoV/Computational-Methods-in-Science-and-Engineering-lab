North American Taiwan Studies Association

The North American Taiwan Studies Association (NATSA) is an American 501(c)(3) nonprofit academic organization established in 1994. It is operated by overseas Taiwanese students, North American doctoral students, and recent graduates who are interested in Taiwan studies. The NATSA annual conferences are the largest academic events on Taiwan Studies in North America. The NATSA conferences not only provide scholars and students of Taiwan Studies a regular forum to meet and exchange intellectual ideas, but also allow researchers on East-Asia and beyond to receive dynamic feedback and broaden their academic horizons.

When NATSA was founded, it was known as the North American Taiwan Studies Conference and was located on the web at www.natsc.org until August 2006 when it switched to its current address.

The NATSA professional development webinars started in August, 2017. The objectives of the series are:
