Che vuoi

Che vuoi? (?) alternatively described as ma che vuoi?, ma che dici/ma che stai dicendo? (but what are you saying?) or simply Che? is one of the most well known hand gestures in Italy, with gesturesÂ being a very common method of communicative expression in Italy. It is made where the tips of all the fingers of one hand are brought together to form an "upward pointing cone", with the hand then being moved up and down either from the wrist or forearm. The hand can be motionless while performing this hand gesture, or can also be shaken up and down, if the person wants to express impatience. While it is particularly common in Naples, it is a gesture that is widely used in Italy. The meaning is open to interpretation based on context but the frequency and speed of vertical motion indicates the level of frustration of the speaker. As "pinched fingers" an image of the hand held in this gesture was approved as part of Unicode 13 in 2020.
