Cormophyte

Cormophytes (Cormophyta) are the "plants differentiated into roots, shoots and leaves, and well adapted for life on land, comprising pteridophytes and the Spermatophyta." 
These plants differ from thallophytes, whose body is referred to as the thallus, i.e. a simple body not differentiated into leaf and stem, as of lichens, multicellular algae and some liverworts.
