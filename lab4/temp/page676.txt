Bacillus isolates

"Bacillus" isolates have a variety of biotechnological applications.

Nattō-derived "Bacillus" isolates include nootropics pyrazine and tetramethylpyrazine, as well as the anticoagulant enzyme nattokinase.

"Bacillus" is utilized in the production of the chemotherapy medicine L-asparaginase. "Bacillus subtilis" is utilized in the production of hyaluronic acid and α-amylase. "Bacillus thuringiensis" isolates are utilized as biopesticides.

"Bacillus megaterium" has been an important industrial organism for decades. It produces penicillin amidase used to make synthetic penicillin, various amylases used in the baking industry and glucose dehydrogenase used in glucose blood tests. "B. megaterium" is also used for the production of pyruvate, vitamin B12, drugs with fungicidal and antiviral properties, etc. It produces enzymes for modifying corticosteroids, as well as several amino acid dehydrogenases.

"Bacillus subtilis" can biosynthesize silver nanoparticles. "Bacillus badius" can be used to cleaves penicillin G to 6-amino penicillanic acid (6-APA) and phenyl acetic acid (PAA). Certain "Bacillus" have mycorrhiza-like activity and potential bioremediation applications.

Bacillus isolates are used industrially as nutritional probiotics. Additional "Bacillus" isolates include gamma-D-Glutamyl-meso-diaminopimelate peptidase, sonorensin, gamma-cyclodextrin, 2,5-Diketopiperazines, laccases, bacteriocin, paenicidin A, tridecaptin A₁, and paenicidin B.
