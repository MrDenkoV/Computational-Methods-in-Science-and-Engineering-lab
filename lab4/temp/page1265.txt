Alabama Military Academy

Alabama Military Academy, also known as the Fort McClellan Army National Guard Training Center, is a National Guard training school for officer candidates at Fort McClellan, Alabama. It was established in 1957 and has the motto "It shall be done". Alumni include Tulsi Gabbard.

The training center celebrated Fort McClellan's 100th anniversary in 2017.

Cadets participate in a six-mile march at Talladega Speedway.

United States Representative Tulsi Gabbard was the first woman to finish as the distinguished honor graduate in the Academy's 50-year history. 

On February 13, 2009, comedian Sacha Baron Cohen fooled guard officers into allowing him to participate in training at the Alabama Military Academy at Fort McClellan. The officers were led to believe that Cohen was a reporter making a German TV documentary. The incident ended when an Alabama cadet recognized Cohen. Guard spokesperson Staff Sergeant Katrina Timmons stated on March 16, 2009 about the incident, "It's an embarrassment to the Alabama National Guard. Since then we have put in protocols to make sure this doesn't happen again."
