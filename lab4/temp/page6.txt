Black people in Japan

Black people in Japan (黒日本人, "Koku Nihon/Nipponjin" lit. black people) are Japanese residents or citizens of Sub-Saharan African ancestry.

In the mid-16th century, black Africans arrived in Japan alongside white Europeans, as crew members and slaves.

Yasuke, a black slave, possibly from Mozambique, arrived in Japan in the late-16th century alongside Jesuit missionary Alessandro Valignano. He found favor with Oda Nobunaga, the Daimyō and warlord, and ultimately became a samurai.

In 2015, Ariana Miyamoto, born in Japan to a Japanese mother and an African American father, became the first biracial contestant to win the title of Miss Universe Japan. The decision to allow a mixed-race contestant to win the title, particularly one like Miyamoto, who did not appear outwardly Japanese, being much taller than the average Japanese woman with brown skin and afro-textured hair, was controversial.
