{{Performing arts}}
'''Music''' is an [[The arts#Music|art form]], and [[culture|cultural]] activity, whose [[Art medium#Sound|medium]] is sound. General [[definitions of music]] include common elements such as [[pitch (music)|pitch]] (which governs [[melody]] and [[harmony]]), [[rhythm]] (and its associated concepts [[tempo]], [[meter (music)|meter]], and [[articulation (music)|articulation]]), [[dynamics (music)|dynamics]] (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of [[timbre]] and [[texture (music)|texture]] (which are sometimes termed the "color" of a musical sound). Different [[Music genre|styles or types]] of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of [[musical instrument|instruments]] and vocal techniques ranging from singing to [[rapping]]; there are solely [[Instrumental music|instrumental pieces]], [[a capella|solely vocal pieces]] (such as songs without instrumental [[accompaniment]]) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from [[Greek language|Greek]] [[wikt:μουσική#Ancient Greek|μουσική]] (''mousike''; "art of the [[Muse]]s").&lt;ref name="perseus.tufts.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2368891 |title=Mousike, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek–English Lexicon'', at Perseus |publisher=perseus.tufts.edu |accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
See [[glossary of musical terminology]].

In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form or [[Culture|cultural]] activity include the creation of works of music ([[song]]s, tunes, [[symphony|symphonies]], and so on), the [[Music criticism|criticism of music]], the [[Musicology|study of the history of music]], and the [[Aesthetics of music|aesthetic examination of music]]. [[Greek philosophy|Ancient Greek]] and [[Ancient philosophy#Ancient Indian philosophers|Indian philosophers]] defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as "the [[harmony of the spheres]]" and "it is music to my ears" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer [[John Cage]] thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, "There is no [[noise]], only sound."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE1DB1E3BF930A2575BC0A964958260 |title=John Cage, 79, a Minimalist Enchanted With Sound, Dies |last=Kozinn |first=Allen |authorlink=Allan Kozinn |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=13 August 1992 |accessdate=11 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The creation, performance, significance, and even the definition of music vary according to culture and social context. Indeed, throughout history, some new forms or styles of music have been criticized as "not being music", including [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s ''[[Grosse Fuge]]'' [[string quartet]] in 1825,&lt;ref&gt;Watson 2009, 109–10.{{incomplete short citation|date=July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; early [[jazz]] in the beginning of the 1900s&lt;ref&gt;Reiland Rabaka. ''Hip Hop's Amnesia: From Blues and the Black Women's Club Movement to Rap and the [[Hip Hop Movement]]''. Lexington Books, 2012. p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; and [[hardcore punk]] in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Manabe, Noriko. ''The Revolution Will Not Be Televised: Protest Music After Fukushima''. Oxford University Press, 2015. p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; There are many types of music, including [[popular music]], [[traditional music]], [[art music]], [[Liturgical music|music written for religious ceremonies]] and [[work song]]s such as [[chantey]]s. Music ranges from strictly organized compositions–such as Classical music symphonies from the 1700s and 1800s, through to spontaneously played [[Musical improvisation|improvisational music]] such as [[jazz]], and [[avant-garde]] styles of [[aleatory|chance-based]] [[contemporary music]] from the 20th and 21st centuries.

Music can be divided into [[music genre|genres]] (e.g., [[country music]]) and genres can be further divided into [[subgenre]]s (e.g., [[country blues]] and [[pop country]] are two of the many country subgenres), although the dividing lines and relationships between music genres are often subtle, sometimes open to personal interpretation, and occasionally controversial. For example, it can be hard to draw the line between some early 1980s [[hard rock]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]]. Within [[the arts]], music may be classified as a [[performing arts|performing art]], a fine art or as an auditory art. Music may be played or sung and heard live at a [[rock concert]] or orchestra performance, heard live as part of a [[theatre music|dramatic work]] (a [[music theater]] show or opera), or it may be recorded and listened to on a radio, MP3 player, [[CD player]], [[smartphone]] or as [[film score]] or TV show.

In many cultures, music is an important part of people's way of life, as it plays a key role in  [[religious ritual]]s, [[rite of passage]] ceremonies (e.g., graduation and marriage), social activities (e.g., [[dance club|dancing]]) and cultural activities ranging from amateur [[karaoke]] singing to playing in an amateur [[Funk|funk band]] or singing in a community [[choir]]. People may make music as a hobby, like a teen playing cello in a [[youth orchestra]], or work as a professional musician or singer. The [[music industry]] includes the individuals who create new songs and musical pieces (such as songwriters and composers), individuals who perform music (which include orchestra, [[jazz]] band and rock band musicians, singers and conductors), individuals who record music (music producers and [[sound engineer]]s), individuals who organize concert tours, and individuals who sell recordings, [[sheet music]], and scores to customers. Even once a song or piece has been performed, [[music criticism|music critics]], [[music journalism|music journalists]], and [[musicology|music scholars]] may assess and evaluate the piece and its performance.

==Etymology==
[[File:Muses sarcophagus Louvre MR880.jpg|thumb|upright=1.75|In [[Greek mythology]], the nine [[Muse]]s were the inspiration for many creative endeavors, including [[the arts]].]]
The word derives from [[Greek language|Greek]] [[wikt:μουσική#Ancient Greek|μουσική]] (''mousike''; "art of the [[Muses]]").&lt;ref name="perseus.tufts.edu"/&gt; In [[Greek mythology]], the nine [[Muse]]s were the goddesses who inspired literature, science, and [[the arts]] and who were the source of the knowledge embodied in the poetry, song-lyrics, and myths in the Greek culture. According to the ''Online Etymological Dictionary'', the term "music" is derived from "mid-13c., musike, from [[Old French]] ''musique'' (12c.) and directly from [[Latin]] ''musica'' "the art of music," also including poetry (also [the] source of Spanish ''música'', Italian ''musica'', [[Old High German]] ''mosica'', German ''Musik'', Dutch ''muziek'', Danish ''musik'')." This is derived from the "...Greek ''mousike (techne)'' "(art) of the Muses," from fem. of mousikos "pertaining to the Muses," from Mousa "Muse" (see muse (n.)). Modern spelling [dates] from [the] 1630s. In [[classical Greece]], [the term "music" refers to] any art in which the Muses presided, but especially music and [[lyric poetry]]."&lt;ref name="etymonline"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=music |title=music |publisher=Douglas Harper |website=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]] |accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a form of art or entertainment==
[[File:Photo récital 028.JPG|thumb|right|upright=0.9|{{Interlanguage link multi|Jean-Gabriel Ferlan|fr}} performing at a 2008 concert at the collège-lycée Saint-François Xavier]]
Music is composed and performed for many purposes, ranging from aesthetic pleasure, religious or ceremonial purposes, or as an entertainment product for the marketplace. When music was only available through [[sheet music]] scores, such as during the Classical and Romantic eras, music lovers would buy the [[sheet music]] of their favourite pieces and songs so that they could perform them at home on the piano. With the advent of sound recording, records of popular songs, rather than sheet music became the dominant way that music lovers would enjoy their favourite songs. With the advent of home [[tape recorder]]s in the 1980s and [[digital music]] in the 1990s, music lovers could make tapes or [[playlist]]s of their favourite songs and take them with them on a [[Cassette player|portable cassette player]] or MP3 player. Some music lovers create [[mix tape]]s of their favorite songs, which serve as a "self-portrait, a gesture of friendship, prescription for an ideal party... [and] an environment consisting solely of what is most ardently loved."&lt;ref&gt;Kirszner, Laurie G. (January 2012). ''Patterns for College Writing''. Bedford/St. Martin's. p. 520. {{ISBN|978-0-312-67684-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amateur musicians can compose or perform music for their own pleasure, and derive their income elsewhere. [[Professional musician]]s are employed by a range of institutions and organisations, including armed forces (in [[marching band]]s, [[concert band]]s and popular music groups), churches and synagogues, symphony orchestras, broadcasting or [[filmmaking|film production]] companies, and [[music school]]s. Professional musicians sometimes work as freelancers or [[session musician]]s, seeking contracts and engagements in a variety of settings. There are often many links between amateur and professional musicians. Beginning amateur musicians take [[music lesson|lessons]] with professional musicians. In community settings, advanced amateur musicians perform with professional musicians in a variety of ensembles such as community [[concert band]]s and community orchestras.

A distinction is often made between music performed for a live audience and music that is performed in a studio so that it can be recorded and distributed through the music retail system or the broadcasting system. However, there are also many cases where a live performance in front of an audience is also recorded and distributed. Live concert recordings are popular in both classical music and in [[popular music]] forms such as rock, where [[Bootleg recording|illegally taped live concerts]] are prized by music lovers. In the [[jam band]] scene, live, improvised [[jam session]]s are preferred to studio recordings.

===Composition===
{{Main|Musical composition}}
[[File:Coffee and synths. KayoDot album "Hubardo" recording, 2013-06-13.jpg|thumb|People composing music in 2013 using [[electronic keyboard]]s and computers.]]
[[File:Michel Richard Delalande engraving BNF Gallica.jpg|thumb|French [[Baroque music]] composer [[Michel Richard Delalande]] (1657–1726), pen in hand.]]
"Composition" is the act or practice of creating a song, an [[instrumental music]] piece, a work with both singing and instruments, or another type of music. In many cultures, including Western classical music, the act of composing also includes the creation of [[music notation]], such as a [[sheet music|sheet music "score"]], which is then performed by the composer or by other singers or musicians. In popular music and traditional music, the act of composing, which is typically called songwriting, may involve the creation of a basic outline of the song, called the [[lead sheet]], which sets out the [[melody]], [[lyrics]] and [[chord progression]]. In classical music, the composer typically [[orchestration|orchestrates]] his or her own compositions, but in musical theatre and in pop music, songwriters may hire an arranger to do the orchestration. In some cases, a songwriter may not use notation at all, and instead compose the song in her mind and then play or record it from memory. In jazz and popular music, notable recordings by influential performers are given the weight that written scores play in classical music.

Even when music is notated relatively precisely, as in classical music, there are many decisions that a performer has to make, because notation does not specify all of the elements of music precisely. The process of deciding how to perform music that has been previously composed and notated is termed "interpretation". Different performers' interpretations of the same work of music can vary widely, in terms of the tempos that are chosen and the playing or singing style or [[musical phrasing|phrasing]] of the melodies. Composers and songwriters who present their own music are interpreting their songs, just as much as those who perform the music of others. The standard body of choices and techniques present at a given time and a given place is referred to as [[Historically informed performance|performance practice]], whereas interpretation is generally used to mean the individual choices of a performer.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Although a musical composition often uses [[musical notation]] and has a single author, this is not always the case. A work of music can have multiple composers, which often occurs in [[popular music]] when a band collaborates to write a song, or in musical theatre, when one person writes the melodies, a second person writes the lyrics, and a third person orchestrates the songs. In some styles of music, such as the [[blues]], a composer/songwriter may create, perform and record new songs or pieces without ever writing them down in music notation. A piece of music can also be composed with words, images, or computer programs that explain or notate how the singer or musician should create musical sounds. Examples range from avant-garde music that uses [[graphic notation (music)|graphic notation]], to text compositions such as ''[[Aus den sieben Tagen]]'', to computer programs that select sounds for musical pieces. Music that makes heavy use of randomness and chance is called [[aleatoric music]], and is associated with contemporary composers active in the 20th century, such as [[John Cage]], [[Morton Feldman]], and [[Witold Lutosławski]]. A more commonly known example of chance-based music is the sound of [[wind chimes]] jingling in a breeze.

The study of composition has traditionally been dominated by examination of methods and practice of Western classical music, but the definition of composition is broad enough to include the creation of [[popular music]] and [[traditional music]] songs and instrumental pieces as well as spontaneously [[Music improvisation|improvised]] works like those of [[free jazz]] performers and African percussionists such as [[Ewe drumming|Ewe drummers]].

===Notation===
{{Main|Musical notation}}
[[File:Adeste Fideles sheet music sample.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Sheet music is written representation of music. This is a [[homorhythm]]ic (i.e., [[hymn]]-style) arrangement of a traditional piece entitled "[[Adeste Fideles]]", in standard two-staff format for mixed voices.[[File:Adeste Fideles sheet music sample.mid|thumb|left]]]]
In the 2000s, music notation typically means the written expression of music notes and rhythms on paper using symbols. When music is written down, the pitches and rhythm of the music, such as the notes of a [[melody]], are notated. Music notation also often provides instructions on how to perform the music. For example, the sheet music for a song may state that the song is a "slow blues" or a "fast swing", which indicates the tempo and the genre.  To read music notation, a person must have an understanding of [[music theory]], [[harmony]] and the [[performance practice]] associated with a particular song or piece's genre.

Written notation varies with style and period of music. In the 2000s, notated music is produced as [[sheet music]] or, for individuals with computer [[scorewriter]] programs, as an image on a [[computer screen]]. In ancient times, music notation was put onto stone or clay tablets. To perform music from notation, a singer or instrumentalist requires an understanding of the rhythmic and pitch elements embodied in the symbols and the performance practice that is associated with a piece of music or a genre. In genres requiring [[musical improvisation]], the performer often plays from music where only the [[Chord progression|chord changes]] and form of the song are written, requiring the performer to have a great understanding of the music's structure, harmony and the styles of a particular genre (e.g., [[jazz]] or [[country music]]).

In Western art music, the most common types of written notation are scores, which include all the music parts of an ensemble piece, and parts, which are the music notation for the individual performers or singers. In popular music, jazz, and blues, the standard musical notation is the [[lead sheet]], which notates the melody, chords, [[lyrics]] (if it is a vocal piece), and structure of the music. [[Fake book]]s are also used in jazz; they may consist of lead sheets or simply chord charts, which permit [[rhythm section]] members to improvise an [[accompaniment]] part to jazz songs. Scores and parts are also used in popular music and jazz, particularly in large ensembles such as jazz "[[big band]]s." In popular music, guitarists and electric bass players often read music notated in [[tablature]] (often abbreviated as "tab"), which indicates the location of the notes to be played on the instrument using a diagram of the guitar or bass fingerboard. Tabulature was also used in the Baroque era to notate music for the [[lute]], a stringed, fretted instrument.

===Improvisation===
[[File:Johnny Hodges edit.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Improvisation plays a central role in jazz; musicians learn progressions using scale and chord tones (Pictured is [[Johnny Hodges]])]]
{{Main|Musical improvisation}}
[[Musical improvisation]] is the creation of spontaneous music, often within (or based on) a pre-existing harmonic framework or [[chord progression]]. Improvisers use the notes of the chord, various scales that are associated with each chord, and chromatic ornaments and passing tones which may be neither chord tones not from the typical scales associated with a chord. Imorovisay on a song can be done with or without preparation. Improvisation is a major part of some types of music, such as [[blues]], [[jazz]], and [[jazz fusion]], in which instrumental performers improvise solos, melody lines and accompaniment parts. 

In the Western art music tradition, improvisation was an important skill during the Baroque era and during the Classical era. In the Baroque era, performers improvised ornaments and [[basso continuo]] keyboard players improvised [[chord voicing]]s based on [[figured bass]] notation. As well, the top soloists were expected to be able to improvise pieces such as [[prelude]]s. In the Classical era, solo performers and singers improvised virtuoso [[cadenza]]s during concerts.

However, in the 20th and early 21st century, as "common practice" Western [[art music]] performance became institutionalized in symphony orchestras, opera houses and ballets, improvisation has played a smaller role, as more and more music was notated in scores and parts for musicians to play. At the same time, some 20th and 21st century [[art music]] composers have increasingly included improvisation in their creative work. In [[Indian classical music]], improvisation is a core component and an essential criterion of performances.

===Theory===
{{Main|Music theory}}
Music theory encompasses the nature and mechanics of music. It often involves identifying patterns that govern composers' techniques and examining the [[language]] and [[Musical notation|notation]] of music. In a grand sense, music theory distills and analyzes the [[parameter (music)|parameters]] or elements of music – rhythm, [[harmony]] ([[Diatonic function|harmonic function]]), [[melody]], structure, [[Musical form|form]], and [[Texture (music)|texture]]. Broadly, music theory may include any statement, belief, or conception of or about music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Boretz |first=Benjamin |authorlink=Benjamin Boretz |title=Meta-Variations: studies in the foundations of musical thought… |publisher=Open Space |year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; People who study these properties are known as music theorists, and they typically work as professors in colleges, universities, and music conservatories. Some have applied [[acoustics]], [[human physiology]], and [[psychology]] to the explanation of how and why music is [[perceive]]d. Music theorists publish their research in music theory journals and university press books.

==Elements==
{{main|Aspect of music}}
Music has many different fundamentals or elements. Depending on the definition of "element" being used, these can include: pitch, beat or pulse, tempo, rhythm, melody, harmony, texture, style, allocation of voices, timbre or color, dynamics, expression, articulation, form and structure. The elements of music feature prominently in the music curriculums of Australia, UK and US. All three curriculums identify pitch, dynamics, timbre and texture as elements, but the other identified elements of music are far from universally agreed. Below is a list of the three official versions of the "elements of music":

In relation to the UK curriculum, in 2013 the term: "appropriate [[musical notation]]s" was added to their list of elements and the title of the list was changed from the "elements of music" to the "inter-related dimensions of music". The inter-related dimensions of music are listed as: pitch, duration, dynamics, tempo, timbre, texture, structure and appropriate musical notations.&lt;ref&gt;Gov.uk. (2013). ''National curriculum in England: music programmes of study''. Retrieved 6 January 2016, from https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-music-programmes-of-study&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase "the elements of music" is used in a number of different contexts. The two most common contexts can be differentiated by describing them as the "rudimentary elements of music" and the "perceptual elements of music".

===Rudimentary elements===
In the 1800s, the phrases "the elements of music" and "the rudiments of music" were used interchangeably.&lt;ref&gt;[[Muzio Clementi|Clementi, M.]]: "Introduction to the art of playing on the piano forte", Da Capo Press (1974). Cohen, Dalia and Dubnov, Shlomo (1996). "Gestalt phenomena in musical texture", Springer {{doi|10.1007/BFb0034128}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Niecks|first=Frederick|authorlink=Frederick Niecks|year=1884|title=A Concise Dictionary of Musical Terms|url=https://archive.org/details/concisedictionar00niec}}. {{cite journal|title=Review|journal=[[The Musical Times and Singing Class Circular]]|volume=25|number=498|page=473|doi=10.2307/3357513|date=1 August 1884|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/imgsrv/download/pdf?id=hvd.32044041113556;orient=0;size=100;seq=7;attachment=0|jstor=3357513|hdl=2027/uc1.b4284161}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The elements described in these documents refer to aspects of music that are needed in order to become a musician, Recent writers such as Espie Estrella seem to be using the phrase "elements of music" in a similar manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Estrella|first=Espie|date=4 November 2019|title=An Introduction to the Elements of Music|url=https://www.liveabout.com/the-elements-of-music-2455913|website=liveabout.com|access-date=25 February 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; A definition which most accurately reflects this usage is: "the rudimentary principles of an art, science, etc.: the elements of grammar."&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/element "Element"], (n.d.) In Dictionary.com unabridged. Retrieved 10 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The UK's curriculum switch to the "inter-related dimensions of music" seems to be a move back to using the rudimentary elements of music.

===Perceptual elements===
Since the emergence of the study of [[psychoacoustics]] in the 1930s, most lists of elements of music have related more to how we ''hear'' music than how we learn to play it or study it. C.E. Seashore, in his book ''Psychology of Music'',&lt;ref&gt;Seashore, C. E. (1938). ''Psychology of music'': New York: Dover Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; identified four "psychological attributes of sound". These were: "pitch, loudness, time, and timbre" (p.&amp;nbsp;3). He did not call them the "elements of music" but referred to them as "elemental components" (p.&amp;nbsp;2). Nonetheless these elemental components link precisely with four of the most common musical elements: "Pitch" and "timbre" match exactly, "loudness" links with dynamics and "time" links with the time-based elements of rhythm, duration and tempo. This usage of the phrase "the elements of music" links more closely with ''Webster's New 20th Century Dictionary'' definition of an element as: "a substance which cannot be divided into a simpler form by known methods"&lt;ref&gt;Webster, N. (Ed.) (1947) Webster's New Twentieth Century Dictionary. Clevelend Ohio: The World Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt; and educational institutions' lists of elements generally align with this definition as well.

Although writers of lists of "rudimentary elements of music" can vary their lists depending on their personal (or institutional) priorities, the perceptual elements of music should consist of an established (or proven) list of discrete elements which can be independently manipulated to achieve an intended musical effect. It seems at this stage that there is still research to be done in this area.

===Analysis of styles===
[[File:George Clinton 2006.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Funk]] places most of its emphasis on rhythm and [[groove (music)|groove]], with entire songs based around a [[ostinato#Vamp|vamp]] on a single chord. Pictured are the influential funk musicians [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]] and [[Parliament-Funkadelic]] in 2006.]]
Some styles of music place an emphasis on certain of these fundamentals, while others place less emphasis on certain elements. To give one example, while [[Bebop]]-era [[jazz]] makes use of very complex chords, including [[altered dominant]]s and challenging [[chord progression]]s, with chords changing two or more times per bar and keys changing several times in a tune, [[funk]] places most of its emphasis on rhythm and [[groove (music)|groove]], with entire songs based around a [[ostinato#Vamp|vamp]] on a single chord. While Romantic era classical music from the mid- to late-1800s makes great use of dramatic changes of dynamics, from whispering pianissimo sections to thunderous fortissimo sections, some entire Baroque dance suites for [[harpsichord]] from the early 1700s may use a single dynamic. To give another example, while some [[art music]] pieces, such as [[symphony|symphonies]] are very long, some pop songs are just a few minutes long.

===Description of elements===

====Pitch and melody====
[[Pitch (music)|Pitch]] is an aspect of a sound that we can hear, reflecting whether one musical sound, note or tone is "higher" or "lower" than another musical sound, note or tone. We can talk about the highness or lowness of pitch in the more general sense, such as the way a listener hears a piercingly high [[piccolo]] note or [[whistling]] tone as higher in pitch than a deep thump of a [[bass drum]]. We also talk about pitch in the precise sense associated with musical [[melody|melodies]], [[bassline]]s and [[chord (music)|chords]]. Precise pitch can only be determined in sounds that have a frequency that is clear and stable enough to distinguish from noise. For example, it is much easier for listeners to discern the pitch of a single note played on a piano  than to try to discern the pitch of a [[crash cymbal]] that is struck.
[[File:Popgoesweasel.jpg|thumb|upright=2.5|The melody to the traditional song "[[Pop Goes the Weasel]]"  [[File:Pop Goes the Weasel.ogg|thumb]]]]

A [[melody]] (also called a "tune") is a series of pitches (notes) sounding in succession (one after the other), often in a rising and falling pattern. The notes of a melody are typically created using pitch systems such as [[Musical scale|scales]] or [[Musical mode|modes]]. Melodies also often contain notes from the chords used in the song. The melodies in simple folk songs and traditional songs may use only the notes of a single scale, the scale associated with the tonic note or [[key (music)|key]] of a given song. For example, a folk song in the key of C (also referred to as C major) may have a melody that uses only the notes of the C major scale (the individual notes C, D, E, F, G, A, B and C; these are the "[[white notes]]" on a piano keyboard. On the other hand, [[Bebop]]-era jazz from the 1940s and [[contemporary music]] from the 20th and 21st centuries may use melodies with many [[chromatic note]]s (i.e., notes in addition to the notes of the major scale; on a piano, a chromatic scale would include all the notes on the keyboard, including the "white notes" and "black notes" and unusual scales, such as the [[whole tone scale]] (a whole tone scale in the key of C would contain the notes C, D, E, F{{music|sharp}}, G{{music|sharp}} and A{{music|sharp}}). A low, deep musical line played by bass instruments such as double bass, electric bass or [[tuba]] is called a [[bassline]].

====Harmony and chords====
[[File:Sol7 accordo chitarra G7 guitar chord.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|When musicians play three or more different [[Musical note|notes]] at the same time, this creates a [[Chord (music)|chord]]. In [[Western culture#Music|Western music]], including classical music, pop music, rock music and many related styles, the most common chords are [[triad (music)|triads]]– three notes usually played at the same time. The most commonly used chords are the [[major chord]] and the [[minor chord]]. An example of a major chord is the three pitches C, E and G. An example of a minor chord is the three pitches A, C and E. (Pictured is a [[guitar player]] performing a chord on a guitar).]]
[[Harmony]] refers to the "vertical" sounds of pitches in music, which means pitches that are played or sung together at the same time to create a [[chord (music)|chord]]. Usually this means the notes are played at the same time, although harmony may also be implied by a melody that outlines a harmonic structure (i.e., by using melody notes that are played one after the other, outlining the notes of a chord). In music written using the system of major-minor [[tonality]] ("keys"), which includes most classical music written from 1600 to 1900 and most Western pop, rock and traditional music, the key of a piece determines the scale used, which centres around the "home note" or [[tonic (music)|tonic]] of the key. Simple classical pieces and many pop and traditional music songs are written so that all the music is in a single key. More complex Classical, pop and traditional music songs and pieces may have two keys (and in some cases three or more keys). Classical music from the Romantic era (written from about 1820–1900) often contains multiple keys, as does [[jazz]], especially [[Bebop]] jazz from the 1940s, in which the key or "home note" of a song may change every four bars or even every two bars.

====Rhythm====
Rhythm is the arrangement of sounds and silences in time. [[Metre (music)|Meter]] animates time in regular pulse groupings, called [[Bar (music)|measures or bars]], which in Western classical, popular and traditional music often group notes in sets of two (e.g., 2/4 time), three (e.g., 3/4 time, also known as [[Waltz]] time, or 3/8 time), or four (e.g., 4/4 time). Meters are made easier to hear because songs and pieces often (but not always) place an emphasis on the first beat of each grouping. Notable exceptions exist, such as the [[backbeat]] used in much Western pop and rock, in which a song that uses a measure that consists of four beats (called 4/4 time or [[common time]]) will have accents on beats two and four, which are typically performed by the drummer on the [[snare drum]], a loud and distinctive-sounding percussion instrument. In pop and rock, the rhythm parts of a song are played by the [[rhythm section]], which includes chord-playing instruments (e.g., electric guitar, acoustic guitar, piano, or other keyboard instruments), a bass instrument (typically electric bass or for some styles such as [[jazz]] and [[bluegrass (music)|bluegrass]], double bass) and a drum kit player.

====Texture====
[[Musical texture]] is the overall sound of a piece of music or song.  The texture of a piece or sing is determined by how the melodic, rhythmic, and harmonic materials are combined in a composition, thus determining the overall nature of the sound in a piece. Texture is often described in regard to the density, or thickness, and range, or width, between lowest and highest pitches, in relative terms as well as more specifically distinguished according to the number of voices, or parts, and the relationship between these voices (see common types below). For example, a thick texture contains many 'layers' of instruments. One of these layers could be a string section, or another brass. The thickness also is affected by the amount and the richness of the instruments. Texture is commonly described according to the number of and relationship between [[part (music)|parts]] or lines of music:
* [[monophony]]: a single [[melody]] (or "tune") with neither instrumental [[accompaniment]] nor a [[harmony part]]. A mother singing a [[lullaby]] to her baby would be an example.
* [[heterophony]]: two or more instruments or singers playing/singing the same melody, but with each performer slightly varying the rhythm or speed of the melody or adding different [[ornament (music)|ornaments]] to the melody. Two [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] [[fiddler]]s playing the same [[traditional music|traditional]] fiddle tune together will typically each vary the melody a bit and each add different ornaments.
* [[polyphony]]: multiple independent melody lines that interweave together, which are sung or played at the same time. [[Choir|Choral]] music written in the [[Renaissance music]] era was typically written in this style. A [[round (music)|round]], which is a song such as "[[Row, Row, Row Your Boat]]", which different groups of singers all start to sing at a different time, is a simple example of polyphony.
* [[homophony]]: a clear melody supported by [[chord (music)|chordal]] [[accompaniment]]. Most Western [[popular music]] songs from the 19th century onward are written in this texture.

Music that contains a large number of independent [[Part (music)|parts]] (e.g., a double concerto accompanied by 100 orchestral instruments with many interweaving melodic lines) is generally said to have a "thicker" or "denser" texture than a work with few parts (e.g., a solo [[flute]] melody accompanied by a single cello).

====Timbre or "tone color"====
{{Main|Timbre}}
Timbre, sometimes called "color" or "tone color" is the quality or sound of a voice or instrument.&lt;ref&gt;Harnsberger, Lindsey. "Articulation." ''Essential Dictionary of Music''. Alfred Publishing Co., Inc. Los Angeles, CA.&lt;/ref&gt; Timbre is what makes a particular musical sound different from another, even when they have the same pitch and loudness. For example, a 440&amp;nbsp;Hz A note sounds different when it is played on [[oboe]], piano, violin or electric guitar. Even if different players of the same instrument play the same note, their notes might sound different due to differences in instrumental technique (e.g., different [[embouchure]]s), different types of accessories (e.g., mouthpieces for brass players, reeds for oboe and bassoon players) or strings made out of different materials for string players (e.g., [[gut string]]s versus [[steel strings]]). Even two instrumentalists playing the same note on the same instrument (one after the other) may sound different due to different ways of playing the instrument (e.g., two string players might hold the bow differently).

The physical characteristics of sound that determine the perception of timbre include the [[spectrum]], [[envelope (waves)|envelope]] and [[overtone]]s of a note or musical sound. For [[music technology (electric)|electric]] instruments developed in the 20th century, such as electric guitar, electric bass and [[electric piano]], the performer can also change the tone by adjusting [[Graphic equalizer|equalizer controls]], tone controls on the instrument, and by using [[effects unit|electronic effects units]] such as [[distortion (music)|distortion]] pedals. The tone of the electric [[Hammond organ]] is controlled by adjusting [[Hammond organ#Drawbars|drawbars]].

====Expression====
[[File:20110921-FSIS-RBN-6084 - Flickr - USDAgov.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.75|Singers add expression to the melodies they sing using many methods, including changing the tone of their singing, adding [[vibrato]] to certain notes, and emphasizing important words in the lyrics.]]
Expressive qualities are those elements in music that create change in music without changing the main pitches or substantially changing the rhythms of the melody and its accompaniment. Performers, including singers and instrumentalists, can add musical expression to a song or piece by adding [[Musical phrasing|phrasing]], by adding effects such as [[vibrato]] (with voice and some instruments, such as guitar, violin, brass instruments and woodwinds), dynamics (the loudness or softness of piece or a section of it), tempo fluctuations (e.g., [[ritardando]] or [[Tempo|accelerando]], which are, respectively slowing down and speeding up the tempo), by adding pauses or [[fermata]]s on a [[cadence (music)|cadence]], and by changing the articulation of the notes (e.g., making notes more pronounced or accented, by making notes more [[legato]], which means smoothly connected, or by making notes shorter).

Expression is achieved through the manipulation of pitch (such as inflection, vibrato, slides etc.), volume (dynamics, accent, tremolo etc.), duration (tempo fluctuations, rhythmic changes, changing note duration such as with legato and staccato,  etc.), timbre (e.g. changing vocal timbre from a light to a resonant voice) and sometimes even texture (e.g. doubling the bass note for a richer effect in a piano piece). Expression therefore can be seen as a manipulation of all elements in order to convey "an indication of mood, spirit, character etc." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=the definition of expression |url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/expression |website=Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.com |accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as such cannot be included as a unique perceptual element of music,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Burton |first1=Russell |title=The elements of music: What are they, and who cares? |journal=Educating for Life. ASME XXTH National Conference Proceeding. Australian Society for Music Education. |date=2015 |page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it can be considered an important rudimentary element of music.

====Form====

From the 1960s onward, Western pop and rock songs are often in [[verse-chorus form]], which is based around a sequence of [[verse (popular music)|verse]] and [[chorus (song)|chorus]] ("refrain") sections, with new [[lyrics]] for most verses and repeating lyrics for the choruses. Popular music often makes use of [[strophic form]], sometimes in conjunction with the [[twelve bar blues]].{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

In the tenth edition of ''[[The Oxford Companion to Music]]'', [[Percy Scholes]] defines musical form as "a series of strategies designed to find a successful mean between the opposite extremes of unrelieved repetition and unrelieved alteration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Scholes |first=Percy A. |authorlink1=Percy Scholes |title=The Oxford Companion to Music |edition=10 |year=1977 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location= |isbn= |chapter=Form |ref=CITEREFScholes1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of common forms of Western music include the [[fugue]], the [[Invention (musical composition)|invention]], [[Sonata form|sonata-allegro]], [[Canon (music)|canon]], [[strophic]], [[theme and variations]], and [[rondo]].

Scholes states that European classical music had only six stand-alone forms: simple binary, simple ternary, compound binary, rondo, air with variations, and [[fugue]] (although musicologist [[Alfred Mann (musicologist)|Alfred Mann]] emphasized that the fugue is primarily a method of composition that has sometimes taken on certain structural conventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mann |first=Alfred |title=The Study of Fugue |year=1958 |publisher=W.W.Norton and Co. Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

Where a piece cannot readily be broken down into sectional units (though it might borrow some form from a poem, story or [[Programme music|programme]]), it is said to be [[through-composed]]. Such is often the case with a [[Fantasia (music)|fantasia]], [[Prelude (music)|prelude]], [[Rhapsody (music)|rhapsody]], [[etude]] (or study), [[symphonic poem]], [[Bagatelle (music)|Bagatelle]], [[impromptu]], etc.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} Professor Charles Keil classified forms and formal detail as "sectional, developmental, or variational."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Keil |first=Charles |title=Urban blues |url=https://archive.org/details/urbanblues0000keil |url-access=registration |year=1966 |isbn=978-0-226-42960-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Sectional form
This form is built from a sequence of clear-cut units&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wennerstrom |first=Mary |editor=Wittlich, Gary |title=Aspects of Twentieth-Century Music |year=1975 |publisher=Prentice-Hall |location=Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey |isbn=978-0-13-049346-0 |chapter=Form in Twentieth Century Music |ref=CITEREFDeLone1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; that may be referred to by letters but also often have generic names such as [[Introduction (music)|introduction]] and [[Coda (music)|coda]], exposition, development and [[recapitulation (music)|recapitulation]], verse, chorus or [[refrain]], and [[Bridge (music)|bridge]]. Introductions and codas, when they are no more than that, are frequently excluded from formal analysis. All such units may typically be eight measures long. Sectional forms include:

;Strophic form
This form is defined by its "unrelieved repetition" ('''AAAA'''...).

;Medley

[[Medley (music)|Medley]], [[Potpourri (music)|potpourri]] is the extreme opposite, that of "unrelieved variation": it is simply an indefinite sequence of self-contained sections ('''ABCD'''...), sometimes with repeats ('''AABBCCDD'''...).  Examples include orchestral [[overture]]s, which are sometimes no more than a string of the best tunes of the musical theatre show or opera to come.

;Binary form
[[File:Binary form.png|thumb|Binary form in major and minor keys. Each section must be at least three phrases long.&lt;ref&gt;White, John D. (1976). ''The Analysis of Music'', p. 50. {{ISBN|0-13-033233-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

This form uses two sections ('''AB'''...), each often repeated ('''AABB'''...). In 18th-century Western classical music, "simple binary" form was often used for dances and carried with it the convention that the two sections should be in different [[musical key]]s but same rhythm, duration and tone. The alternation of two tunes gives enough variety to permit a dance to be extended for as long as desired.
b
;Ternary form
This form has three parts. In Western classical music a simple ternary form has a third section that is a recapitulation of the first ('''ABA'''). Often, the first section is repeated ('''AABA'''). This approach was popular in the 18th-century operatic [[aria]],{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} and was called ''[[da capo]]'' (i.e. "repeat from the top") form. Later, it gave rise to the [[thirty-two-bar form|32-bar song]], with the '''B''' section then often referred to as the "middle eight". A song has more need than a dance of a self-contained form with a beginning and an end of course.

;Rondo form
This form has a recurring theme alternating with different (usually contrasting) sections called "episodes". It may be asymmetrical ('''ABACADAEA''') or symmetrical ('''ABACABA'''). A recurring section, especially the main theme, is sometimes more thoroughly varied, or else one episode may be a "development" of it. A similar arrangement is the [[ritornello]] form of the Baroque [[concerto grosso]]. [[Arch form]] ('''ABCBA''') resembles a symmetrical rondo without intermediate repetitions of the main theme. It is normally used in a round.

;Variational form
Variational forms are those in which variation is an important formative element.

'''[[Theme and Variations]]:''' a [[theme (music)|theme]], which in itself can be of any shorter form (binary, ternary, etc.), forms the only "section" and is repeated indefinitely (as in strophic form) but is varied each time (A, B, A, F, Z, A), so as to make a sort of sectional chain form. An important variant of this, much used in 17th-century British music and in the [[Passacaglia]] and [[Chaconne]], was that of the [[ground bass]] – a repeating bass theme or ''basso [[ostinato]]'' over and around which the rest of the structure unfolds, often, but not always, spinning [[polyphony|polyphonic]] or [[counterpoint|contrapuntal]] threads, or improvising [[division (music)|divisions]] and [[descant]]s. This is said by Scholes (1977) to be the form ''par excellence'' of unaccompanied or accompanied solo instrumental music. The [[Rondo]] is often found with sections varied ('''AA&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;BA&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;CA&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;BA&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;''') or ('''ABA&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;CA&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;B&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;A''').

;Developmental form
Developmental forms are built directly from smaller units, such as [[motif (music)|motifs]]. A well-known Classical piece with a motif is [[Beethoven's fifth symphony]], which starts with three short repeated notes and then a long note. In Classical pieces that are based on motifs, the motif is usually combined, varied and worked out in different ways, perhaps having a symmetrical or arch-like underpinning and a progressive development from beginning to end. By far the most important developmental form in Western classical music is [[Sonata form]].

This form, also known as ''sonata'' form, first movement form, compound binary, ternary and a variety of other names,{{Such as?|date=September 2011}} developed from the binary-formed dance movement described above but is almost always cast in a greater ternary form having the nominal subdivisions of ''Exposition, Development'' and ''Recapitulation''. Usually, but not always, the "A" parts ([[Exposition (music)|Exposition]] and [[Recapitulation (music)|Recapitulation]], respectively) may be subdivided into two or three [[theme (music)|themes]] or theme groups which are taken asunder and recombined to form the "B" part (the [[musical development|development]]) – thus e. g. (AabB[dev. of a and/or b]A&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;ab&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;+coda). This developmental form is generally confined to certain sections of the piece, as to the middle section of the first movement of a sonata, though 19th-century composers such as [[Berlioz]], [[Liszt]] and [[Wagner]] made valiant efforts to derive large-scale works purely or mainly from the motif.

[[Prehistoric music]] can only be theorized based on findings from [[paleolithic]] archaeology sites. [[Paleolithic flutes|Flutes]] are often discovered, carved from bones in which lateral holes have been pierced; these are thought to have been blown at one end like the Japanese [[shakuhachi]]. The [[Divje Babe flute]], carved from a [[cave bear]] [[femur]], is thought to be at least 40,000 years old.

[[Asian music]] covers the music cultures of [[Arabic music|Arabia]], [[Central Asian music|Central Asia]], [[East Asian music|East Asia]], [[South Asian music|South Asia]], and [[Southeast Asian music|Southeast Asia]]. [[Chinese classical music]], the traditional art or court music of China, has a history stretching over around three thousand years. It has its own unique systems of musical notation, as well as musical tuning and pitch, musical instruments and styles or musical genres. Chinese music is pentatonic-diatonic, having a scale of twelve notes to an octave (5&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;7&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;12) as does European-influenced music. [[Persian traditional music|Persian music]] is the music of [[Iran|Persia]] and Persian language countries: ''musiqi'', the science and art of music, and ''muzik'', the sound and performance of music (Sakata 1983).

===References in the Bible===

[[File:David-harp.jpg|thumb|"David with his harp" [[Paris Psalter]],&lt;br /&gt;c. 960, [[Constantinople]]]]

Knowledge of the biblical period is mostly from literary references in the [[Bible]] and post-biblical sources. Religion and music historian Herbert Lockyer, Jr. writes that "music, both vocal and instrumental, was well cultivated among the [[Hebrews]], the [[New Testament]] Christians, and the [[Christian church]] through the centuries."&lt;ref name=Lockyer&gt;Lockyer, Herbert Jr. ''All the Music of the Bible'', Hendrickson Publ. (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; He adds that "a look at the [[Old Testament]] reveals how God's ancient people were devoted to the study and practice of music, which holds a unique place in the historical and prophetic books, as well as the Psalter."

Music and theatre scholars studying the history and anthropology of [[Semitic people|Semitic]] and early [[Judeo-Christian]] culture have discovered common links in theatrical and musical activity between the classical cultures of the [[Hebrews]] and those of later [[Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. The common area of performance is found in a "social phenomenon called [[litany]]," a form of prayer consisting of a series of [[invocation]]s or [[supplication]]s. The ''[[Journal of Religion and Theatre]]'' notes that among the earliest forms of litany, "Hebrew litany was accompanied by a rich musical tradition:"&lt;ref name=JRT&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061004134128/http://www.rtjournal.org/vol_5/no_1/krahenbuhl.html "A Theatre Before the World: Performance History at the Intersection of Hebrew, Greek, and Roman Religious Processional"], ''[[Journal of Religion and Theatre]]'', Vol. 5, No. 1, Summer 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Genesis 4.21 indicated that Jubal is the "father of all such as handle the harp and pipe", the Pentateuch is nearly silent about the practice and instruction of music in the early life of Israel". In I Samuel 10, there are more depictions of "large choirs and orchestras". These large ensembles could only be run with extensive rehearsals. This had led some scholars to theorize that the prophet Samuel led a public music school to a wide range of students.&lt;ref name=JRT /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Greek [[music theory]] included the Greek [[musical mode]]s, that eventually became the basis for Western [[religious music|religious]] and [[European classical music|classical]] music.

The [[Medieval Music|medieval]] era (476 to 1400), which took place during the [[Middle Ages]], started with the introduction of [[monophony|monophonic]] (single melodic line) [[Gregorian chant|chanting]] into [[Roman Catholic Church]] services. [[Musical notation]] was used since Ancient times in [[Ancient Greece|Greek culture]], but in the Middle Ages, notation was first introduced by the [[Catholic church]] so that the chant melodies could be written down, to facilitate the use of the same melodies for religious music across the entire Catholic empire. The only European Medieval repertory that has been found in written form from before 800 is the [[monophony|monophonic]] [[Liturgy|liturgical]] [[plainsong]] chant of the Roman Catholic Church, the central tradition of which was called [[Gregorian chant]].&lt;!--+Add refs to others, e.g. Gallican, Mozarabic, &amp;c.?--&gt; Alongside these traditions of [[Religious music|sacred]] and [[church music]] there existed a vibrant tradition of [[Secular music|secular song]] (non-religious songs). Examples of composers from this period are [[Léonin]], [[Pérotin]], [[Guillaume de Machaut]], and [[Walther von der Vogelweide]].

[[Renaissance music]] (c. 1400 to 1600) was more focused on secular (non-religious) themes, such as [[courtly love]]. Around 1450, the [[printing press]] was invented, which made printed [[sheet music]] much less expensive and easier to mass-produce (prior to the invention of the printing press, all notated music was hand-copied). The increased availability of sheet music helped to spread musical styles more quickly and across a larger area. Musicians and singers often worked for the church, courts and towns. Church choirs grew in size, and the church remained an important patron of music. By the middle of the 15th century, composers wrote richly polyphonic sacred music, in which different melody lines were interwoven simultaneously. Prominent composers from this era include [[Guillaume Dufay]], [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]], [[Thomas Morley]], and [[Orlande de Lassus]]. As musical activity shifted from the church to the aristocratic courts, kings, queens and princes competed for the finest composers. Many leading important composers came from the Netherlands, Belgium, and northern France. They are called the Franco-Flemish composers. They held important positions throughout Europe, especially in Italy. Other countries with vibrant musical activity included Germany, England, and Spain.

The [[Baroque music|Baroque era of music]] took place from 1600 to 1750, as the [[Baroque|Baroque artistic style]] flourished across Europe; and during this time, music expanded in its range and complexity. Baroque music began when the first operas (dramatic solo vocal music accompanied by orchestra) were written. During the Baroque era, [[polyphony|polyphonic]] [[Counterpoint|contrapuntal]] music, in which multiple, simultaneous independent melody lines were used, remained important (counterpoint was important in the vocal music of the Medieval era). German Baroque composers wrote for small [[Musical ensemble|ensembles]] including [[String section|strings]], [[Brass instrument|brass]], and [[Woodwind instrument|woodwinds]], as well as for [[choir]]s and keyboard instruments such as [[organ (music)|pipe organ]], [[harpsichord]], and [[clavichord]]. During this period several major music forms were defined that lasted into later periods when they were expanded and evolved further, including the [[fugue]], the [[Invention (musical composition)|invention]], the [[sonata]], and the concerto.&lt;ref name="sdsu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://trumpet.sdsu.edu/M345/Baroque_Music1.html |title=''Baroque Music'' by Elaine Thornburgh and Jack Logan, Ph.D |publisher=trumpet.sdsu.edu |accessdate=27 October 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905175129/http://trumpet.sdsu.edu/M345/Baroque_Music1.html |archivedate=5 September 2015 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The late Baroque style was polyphonically complex and richly ornamented. Important composers from the Baroque era include [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] (''[[Bach cello suites|Cello suites]]''), [[George Frideric Handel]] (''[[Handel's Messiah|Messiah]]''), [[Georg Philipp Telemann]] and [[Antonio Lucio Vivaldi]] (''[[The Four Seasons (Vivaldi)|The Four Seasons]]'').

The music of the [[Classical period (music)|Classical period]] (1730 to 1820) aimed to imitate what were seen as the key elements of the art and philosophy of Ancient Greece and Rome: the ideals of balance, proportion and disciplined expression. (Note: the music from the [[Classical period (music)|Classical period]] should not be confused with Classical music in general, a term which refers to Western [[art music]] from the 5th century to the 2000s, which includes the Classical period as one of a number of periods).  Music from the Classical period has a lighter, clearer and considerably simpler texture than the [[Baroque music]] which preceded it. The main style was [[homophony]],&lt;ref&gt;Blume, Friedrich. Classic and Romantic Music: A Comprehensive Survey. New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, 1970. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; where a prominent [[melody]] and a subordinate chordal [[accompaniment]] part are clearly distinct. Classical instrumental melodies tended to be almost voicelike and singable. New genres were developed, and the [[fortepiano]], the forerunner to the modern piano, replaced the Baroque era [[harpsichord]] and [[pipe organ]] as the main keyboard instrument (though pipe organ continued to be used in sacred music, such as Masses).

Importance was given to [[instrumental]] music. It was dominated by further development of musical forms initially defined in the Baroque period: the [[sonata]], the concerto, and the [[symphony]]. Others main kinds were the [[Trio (music)|trio]], [[string quartet]], [[serenade]] and [[divertimento]]. The sonata was the most important and developed form. Although Baroque composers also wrote sonatas, the Classical style of sonata is completely distinct. All of the main instrumental forms of the Classical era, from string quartets to symphonies and concertos, were based on the structure of the sonata. The instruments used [[chamber music]] and orchestra became more standardized. In place of the [[basso continuo]] group of the Baroque era, which consisted of harpsichord, organ or lute along with a number of bass instruments selected at the discretion of the group leader (e.g., viol, cello, theorbo, serpent), Classical chamber groups used specified, standardized instruments (e.g., a [[string quartet]] would be performed by two violins, a viola and a cello). The Baroque era improvised chord-playing of the continuo keyboardist or lute player was gradually phased out between 1750 and 1800.

One of the most important changes made in the Classical period was the development of public concerts. The aristocracy still played a significant role in the sponsorship of concerts and compositions, but it was now possible for composers to survive without being  permanent employees of queens or princes. The increasing popularity of classical music led to a growth in the number and types of orchestras. The expansion of orchestral concerts necessitated the building of large public performance spaces. Symphonic music including symphonies, musical accompaniment to ballet and mixed vocal/instrumental genres such as opera and [[oratorio]] became more popular.

The best known composers of Classicism are [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach]], [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]], [[Johann Christian Bach]], [[Joseph Haydn]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] and [[Franz Schubert]]. Beethoven and Schubert are also considered to be composers in the later part of the Classical era, as it began to move towards Romanticism.

===Romanticism===

[[Romantic music]] (c. 1810 to 1900) from the 19th century had many elements in common with the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] styles in literature and painting of the era. Romanticism was an artistic, literary, and intellectual movement was characterized by its emphasis on emotion and individualism as well as glorification of all the past and nature. Romantic music expanded beyond the rigid styles and forms of the Classical era into more passionate, dramatic expressive pieces and songs. Romantic composers such as [[Wagner]] and [[Brahms]] attempted to increase emotional expression and power in their music to describe deeper truths or human feelings. With symphonic [[tone poem]]s, composers tried to tell stories and evoke images or landscapes using instrumental music. Some composers promoted [[Nationalism|nationalistic]] pride with patriotic orchestral music inspired by [[folk music]]. The emotional and expressive qualities of music came to take precedence over tradition.

Romantic composers grew in idiosyncrasy, and went further in the [[syncretism]] of exploring different art-forms in a musical context, (such as literature), history (historical figures and legends), or nature itself. [[Romantic love]] or longing was a prevalent theme in many works composed during this period. In some cases the formal structures from the classical period continued to be used (e.g., the [[sonata form]] used in [[string quartet]]s and [[symphony|symphonies]]), but these forms were expanded and altered. In many cases, new approaches were explored for existing genres, forms, and functions. Also, new forms were created that were deemed better suited to the new subject matter. Composers continued to develop opera and ballet music, exploring new styles and themes.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;

In the years after 1800, the music developed by [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] and [[Franz Schubert]] introduced a more dramatic, expressive style. In Beethoven's case, short [[motif (music)|motifs]], developed organically, came to replace [[melody]] as the most significant compositional unit (an example is the distinctive four note figure used in his [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Fifth Symphony]]). Later Romantic composers such as [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]], [[Antonín Dvořák]], and [[Gustav Mahler]] used more unusual [[chord (music)|chords]] and more [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonance]] to create dramatic tension. They generated complex and often much longer musical works. During the late Romantic period, composers explored dramatic [[Chromatic (music)|chromatic]] alterations of [[tonality]], such as [[extended chord]]s and [[altered chord]]s, which created new sound "colours". The late 19th century saw a dramatic expansion in the size of the orchestra, and the [[industrial revolution]] helped to create better instruments, creating a more powerful sound. Public concerts became an important part of well-to-do [[urban culture|urban]] society. It also saw a new diversity in [[theatre music]], including [[operetta]], and [[Edwardian musical comedy|musical comedy]] and other forms of musical theatre.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;

===20th and 21st century music===
{{Main|20th-century music}}

In the 19th century, one of the key ways that new compositions became known to the public was by the sales of [[sheet music]], which middle class amateur music lovers would perform at home on their piano or other common instruments, such as violin. With [[20th-century music]], the invention of new [[music technology (electric)|electric technologies]] such as [[radio broadcasting]] and the [[mass market]] availability of [[gramophone record]]s meant that [[sound recording]]s of songs and pieces heard by listeners (either on the radio or on their record player) became the main way to learn about new songs and pieces. There was a vast increase in music listening as the radio gained popularity and [[phonograph]]s were used to replay and distribute music, because whereas in the 19th century, the focus on sheet music restricted access to new music to the middle class and upper-class people who could read music and who owned pianos and instruments, in the 20th century, anyone with a radio or record player could hear operas, [[symphony|symphonies]] and [[big band]]s right in their own living room. This allowed lower-income people, who would never be able to afford an opera or symphony concert ticket to hear this music. It also meant that people could hear music from different parts of the country, or even different parts of the world, even if they could not afford to travel to these locations. This helped to spread musical styles.

The focus of [[art music]] in the 20th century was characterized by exploration of new rhythms, styles, and sounds. The horrors of [[World War I]] influenced many of the arts, including music, and some composers began exploring darker, harsher sounds. [[Traditional music]] styles such as [[jazz]] and [[folk music]] were used by composers as a source of ideas for classical music. [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Arnold Schoenberg]], and [[John Cage]] were all influential composers in 20th-century art music. The invention of [[sound recording]] and the ability to edit music gave rise to new subgenre of classical music, including the [[acousmatic]]&lt;ref&gt;Schaeffer, P. (1966), Traité des objets musicaux, Le Seuil, Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Musique concrète]] schools of electronic composition. Sound recording was also a major influence on the development of popular music genres, because it enabled recordings of songs and bands to be widely distributed. The introduction of the [[multitrack recording]] system had a major influence on rock music, because it could do much more than record a band's performance. Using a multitrack system, a band and their music producer could overdub many layers of instrument tracks and vocals, creating new sounds that would not be possible in a live performance.

[[Jazz]] evolved and became an important genre of music over the course of the 20th century, and during the second half of that century, rock music did the same. Jazz is an American musical artform that originated in the beginning of the 20th century in African American communities in the Southern United States from a confluence of [[Music of Africa|African]] and European music traditions. The style's West African pedigree is evident in its use of [[blue note]]s, [[improvisation]], [[polyrhythm]]s, [[syncopation]], and the [[swung note]].&lt;ref&gt;Alyn Shipton, ''A New History of Jazz'', 2nd. ed., Continuum, 2007, pp. 4–5&lt;/ref&gt;

Rock music is a genre of [[popular music]] that developed in the 1960s from 1950s [[rock and roll]], [[rockabilly]], [[blues]], and [[country music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Gilliland |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19838/m1/ |title=Show 55 – Crammer: A lively cram course on the history of rock and some other things|show=55}}{{Time needed|date=February 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sound of rock often revolves around the electric guitar or acoustic guitar, and it uses a strong [[Backbeat (music)|back beat]] laid down by a [[rhythm section]]. Along with the guitar or keyboards, saxophone and blues-style harmonica are used as soloing instruments. In its "purest form", it "has three chords, a strong, insistent back beat, and a catchy melody".{{Cite quote|date=February 2020}} The traditional rhythm section for popular music is rhythm guitar, electric bass guitar, drums. Some bands also have keyboard instruments such as organ, piano, or, since the 1970s, [[analog synthesizer]]s. In the 1980s, pop musicians began using digital synthesizers, such as the [[DX-7]] synthesizer, electronic [[drum machine]]s such as the [[TR-808]] and synth bass devices (such as the [[TB-303]]) or [[synth bass]] keyboards. In the 1990s, an increasingly large range of computerized hardware musical devices and instruments and software (e.g., [[digital audio workstation]]s)  were used. In the 2020s, [[soft synth]]s and computer music apps make it possible for [[bedroom producers]] to create and record some types of music, such as [[electronic dance music]] in their own home, adding sampled and digital instruments and editing the recording digitally. In the 1990s, some bands in genres such as [[nu metal]] began including [[DJ]]s in their bands. DJs create music by manipulating recorded music on record players or CD players, using a [[DJ mixer]].

==Performance==
{{Main|Performance}}
[[File:Naxi Musicians I.jpg|thumb|Chinese [[Nakhi|Naxi]] musicians]]

Performance is the physical expression of music, which occurs when a song is sung or when a piano piece, electric guitar melody, symphony, drum beat or other [[Part (music)|musical part]] is played by musicians. In classical music, a musical work is written in [[music notation]] by a composer and then it is performed once the composer is satisfied with its structure and instrumentation. However, as it gets performed, the interpretation of a song or piece can evolve and change. In classical music, instrumental performers, singers or conductors may gradually make changes to the phrasing or tempo of a piece. In popular and traditional music, the performers have a lot more freedom to make changes to the form of a song or piece. As such, in popular and traditional music styles, even when a band plays a [[cover song]], they can make changes to it such as adding a [[guitar solo]] to or inserting an introduction.

A performance can either be planned out and rehearsed (practiced)—which is the norm in classical music, with jazz [[big band]]s and many popular music styles–or [[Musical improvisation|improvised]] over a [[chord progression]] (a sequence of chords), which is the norm in small [[jazz]] and [[blues]] groups. Rehearsals of orchestras, [[concert band]]s and [[choir]]s are led by a conductor. Rock, blues and jazz bands are usually led by the bandleader. A rehearsal is a structured repetition of a song or piece by the performers until it can be sung and/or played correctly and, if it is a song or piece for more than one musician, until the parts are together from a rhythmic and tuning perspective. Improvisation is the creation of a musical idea–a melody or other musical line–created on the spot, often based on scales or pre-existing melodic [[riff]]s.

Many cultures have strong traditions of solo performance (in which one singer or instrumentalist performs), such as in Indian classical music, and in the Western art-music tradition. Other cultures, such as in [[Bali]], include strong traditions of group performance. All cultures include a mixture of both, and performance may range from improvised solo playing to highly planned and organised performances such as the modern classical concert, religious processions, classical music festivals or [[music competition]]s. [[Chamber music]], which is music for a small ensemble with only a few of each type of instrument, is often seen as more intimate than large symphonic works.

===Oral and aural tradition===
Many types of music, such as traditional [[blues]] and [[folk music]] were not written down in [[sheet music]]; instead, they were originally preserved in the memory of performers, and the songs were handed down [[oral history|orally]], from one musician or singer to another, or aurally, in which a performer learns a song "[[Playing by ear (music)|by ear]]". When the composer of a song or piece is no longer known, this music is often classified as "traditional" or as a "folk song". Different musical traditions have different attitudes towards how and where to make changes to the original source material, from quite strict, to those that demand improvisation or modification to the music. A culture's history and stories may also be passed on by ear through song.

===Ornamentation===
{{Main|Ornament (music)}}
[[File:Trel 001.png|thumb|[[trill (music)|Trill]] sign—a rapid alternation between two notes. [[File:Trill example ornaments.mid|thumb|left]]]]
In music, an "ornament" consists of added notes that provide decoration to a melody, bassline or other musical part. The detail included explicitly in the [[Musical notation|music notation]] varies between genres and historical periods. In general, art music notation from the 17th through the 19th centuries required performers to have a great deal of contextual knowledge about performing styles. For example, in the 17th and 18th centuries, music notated for solo performers typically indicated a simple, unadorned melody. Performers were expected to know how to add stylistically appropriate ornaments to add interest to the music, such as [[Trill (music)|trills]] and [[Turn (music)#Turn|turns]]. Different styles of music use different ornaments. A Baroque flute player might add [[mordent]]s, which are short notes that are played before the main melody note, either above or below the main melody note. A blues guitarist playing electric guitar might use string bending to add expression; a [[heavy metal guitar]] player might use [[hammer-on]]s and [[pull-off]]s.

In the 19th century, art music for solo performers may give a general instruction such as to perform the music expressively, without describing in detail how the performer should do this. The performer was expected to know how to use tempo changes, [[accent (music)|accentuation]], and [[Rest (music)|pauses]] (among other devices) to obtain this "expressive" performance style. In the 20th century, art music notation often became more explicit and used a range of markings and annotations to indicate to performers how they should play or sing the piece. In popular music and traditional music styles, performers are expected to know what types of ornaments are stylistically appropriate for a given song or piece, and performers typically add them in an improvised fashion. One exception is note-for-note solos, in which some players precisely recreate a famous version of a solo, such as a [[guitar solo]].

==Philosophy and aesthetics==
{{Main|Philosophy of music|Aesthetics of music}}
[[File:Boldini, Woman in Red.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.75|A painting by [[Boldini]] of a woman playing the piano]]

[[Philosophy of music]] is a subfield of philosophy. The philosophy of music is the study of fundamental questions regarding music. The philosophical study of music has many connections with philosophical questions in [[metaphysics]] and [[aesthetics]].
Some basic questions in the philosophy of music are:

* What is the [[definition of music]]? (What are the [[necessary and sufficient conditions]] for classifying something as music?)
* What is the relationship between music and mind?
* What does [[music history]] reveal to us about the world?
* What is the connection between music and emotions?
* What is meaning in relation to music?

In ancient times, such as with the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]], the [[aesthetics of music]] explored the mathematical and [[cosmological]] dimensions of [[rhythm]]ic and harmonic organization. In the 18th century, focus shifted to the experience of hearing music, and thus to questions about its beauty and human enjoyment (''[[plaisir]]'' and ''[[jouissance]]'') of music. The origin of this philosophic shift is sometimes attributed to [[Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten]] in the 18th century, followed by [[Immanuel Kant]]. Through their writing, the ancient term 'aesthetics', meaning [[sensory perception]], received its present-day connotation. In the 2000s, philosophers have tended to emphasize issues besides beauty and enjoyment. For example, music's capacity to express emotion has been a central issue.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

In the 20th century, important contributions were made by [[Peter Kivy]], [[Jerrold Levinson]], [[Roger Scruton]], and [[Stephen Davies (philosopher)|Stephen Davies]]. However, many musicians, [[music criticism|music critics]], and other non-philosophers have contributed to the aesthetics of music. In the 19th century, a significant debate arose between [[Eduard Hanslick]], a [[music critic]] and [[musicologist]], and composer [[Richard Wagner]] regarding whether music can express meaning. [[Harry Partch]] and some other [[musicologist]]s, such as [[Kyle Gann]], have studied and tried to popularize [[microtonal music]] and the usage of alternate [[musical scale]]s. Also many modern composers like [[La Monte Young]], [[Rhys Chatham]] and [[Glenn Branca]] paid much attention to a scale called [[just intonation]].{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

It is often thought that music has the ability to affect our [[emotions]], [[intellect]], and [[psychology]]; it can assuage our loneliness or incite our passions. The [[philosopher]] [[Plato]] suggests in ''[[Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' that music has a direct effect on the soul. Therefore, he proposes that in the ideal regime music would be closely regulated by the state (Book VII).{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

There has been a strong tendency in the aesthetics of music to emphasize the paramount importance of compositional structure; however, other issues concerning the aesthetics of music include [[lyrics|lyricism]], [[harmony]], [[hypnotism]], [[emotion|emotiveness]], [[Temporal Dynamics of Music and Language|temporal dynamics]], [[resonance]], playfulness, and [[timbre (music)|color]] (see also [[musical development]]).{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

==Psychology==
{{Main|Music psychology}}

Modern music psychology aims to explain and understand musical [[behavior]] and [[experience]].&lt;ref name = Tan&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tan |first1=Siu-Lan |last2=Pfordresher |first2=Peter |last3=Harré |first3=Rom |date=2010 |title=Psychology of Music: From Sound to Significance |location=New York |publisher=Psychology Press |page=2 |isbn=978-1-84169-868-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research in this field and its subfields are primarily [[Empirical research|empirical]]; their knowledge tends to advance on the basis of interpretations of data collected by systematic [[observation]] of and interaction with [[human subject research|human participants]]. In addition to its focus on fundamental perceptions and cognitive processes, music psychology is a field of research with practical relevance for many areas, including music [[musical technique|performance]], [[music composition|composition]], [[music education|education]], [[music criticism|criticism]], and [[music therapy|therapy]], as well as investigations of human [[aptitude]], skill, [[intelligence]], creativity, and [[social behavior]].

===Cognitive neuroscience of music===
{{Main|Cognitive neuroscience of music}}
[[File:Brodmann 41 42.png|right|upright=1.15|thumb|The [[primary auditory cortex]] is one of the main areas associated with superior pitch resolution.]]

[[Cognitive neuroscience]] of music is the scientific study of brain-based mechanisms involved in the cognitive processes underlying music. These behaviours include music listening, performing, composing, reading, writing, and ancillary activities. It also is increasingly concerned with the brain basis for musical aesthetics and musical emotion. The field is distinguished by its reliance on direct observations of the brain, using such techniques as [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI), [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (TMS), [[magnetoencephalography]] (MEG), [[electroencephalography]] (EEG), and [[positron emission tomography]] (PET).

===Cognitive musicology===
{{Main|Cognitive musicology}}
Cognitive musicology is a branch of [[cognitive science]] concerned with [[computer model|computationally modeling]] musical knowledge with the goal of understanding both music and cognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Laske |first=Otto |title=Navigating New Musical Horizons (Contributions to the Study of Music and Dance) |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-313-30632-7 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/ottolaskenavigat0000unse }}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of computer models provides an exacting, interactive medium in which to formulate and test theories and has roots in [[artificial intelligence]] and [[cognitive science]].&lt;ref&gt;Laske, O.

{{Further|Hearing (sense)}}
Psychoacoustics is the scientific study of sound perception. More specifically, it is the branch of science studying the [[psychological]] and [[physiological]] responses associated with sound (including [[speech]] and music). It can be further categorized as a branch of [[psychophysics]].

===Evolutionary musicology===
{{Main|Evolutionary musicology}}

Evolutionary musicology concerns the "origins of music, the question of animal song, selection pressures underlying music evolution", and "music evolution and human evolution".&lt;ref name="Brown, Merker, Wallin"&gt;Wallin, Nils L./Björn Merker/Steven Brown (1999): "An Introduction to Evolutionary Musicology."

===Culture in music cognition===
{{Main|Culture in music cognition}}
{{See also|Ethnomusicology}}

An individual's culture or [[ethnicity]] plays a role in their [[music cognition]], including their [[Psychology of music preference|preferences]], [[Music and emotion|emotional reaction]], and [[music-related memory|musical memory]]. Musical preferences are biased toward culturally familiar musical traditions beginning in infancy, and adults' classification of the emotion of a musical piece depends on both culturally specific and universal structural features.&lt;ref name="Soley 2010"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Soley |first=G. |last2=Hannon |first2=E.

Many ethnographic studies demonstrate that music is a participatory, community-based activity.&lt;ref&gt;Grazian, David. "The Symbolic Economy of Authenticity in the Chicago Blues Scene." in Music Scenes: Local, Translocal, and Virtual. ed. Bennett, Andy and Richard A. Peterson. Nashville: Vanderbilt University Press, 2004. pp. 31–47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Elizabeth Ball (2010). [https://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1125&amp;context=open_access_etds Portland's Independent Music Scene: Formation of Community Identities and Alternative Urban Cultural Landscapes], p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; Music is experienced by individuals in a range of social settings ranging from being alone to attending a large concert, forming a [[music community]], which cannot be understood as a function of individual will or accident; it includes both commercial and non-commercial participants with a shared set of common values. Musical performances take different forms in different cultures and socioeconomic milieus. In Europe and North America, there is often a divide between what types of music are viewed as a "[[high culture]]" and "[[low culture]]." "High culture" types of music typically include Western art music such as Baroque, Classical, Romantic, and modern-era symphonies, concertos, and solo works, and are typically heard in formal concerts in concert halls and churches, with the audience sitting quietly in seats.

Other types of music—including, but not limited to, jazz, blues, [[soul music|soul]], and [[country music|country]]—are often performed in bars, nightclubs, and theatres, where the audience may be able to drink, dance, and express themselves by cheering. Until the later 20th century, the division between "high" and "low" musical forms was widely accepted as a valid distinction that separated out better quality, more advanced "art music" from the popular styles of music heard in bars and dance halls.

However, in the 1980s and 1990s, musicologists studying this perceived divide between "high" and "low" musical genres argued that this distinction is not based on the musical value or quality of the different types of music.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} Rather, they argued that this distinction was based largely on the [[socioeconomic]]s standing or social class of the performers or audience of the different types of music.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} For example, whereas the audience for Classical symphony concerts typically have above-average incomes, the audience for a rap concert in an inner-city area may have below-average incomes.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Even though the performers, audience, or venue where non-"art" music is performed may have a lower socioeconomic status, the music that is performed, such as blues, rap, [[Punk rock|punk]], [[funk]], or [[ska]] may be very complex and sophisticated.

When composers introduce styles of music that break with convention, there can be a strong resistance from academic music experts and popular culture. Late-period Beethoven string quartets, Stravinsky ballet scores, [[serialism]], [[bebop]]-era jazz, hip hop, punk rock, and [[electronica]] have all been considered non-music by some critics when they were first introduced.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} Such themes are examined in the sociology of music. The sociological study of music, sometimes called [[sociomusicology]], is often pursued in departments of sociology, media studies, or music, and is closely related to the field of [[ethnomusicology]].

===Role of women===
{{Main|Women in music}}
[[File:Julius Giere - Clara Wieck im Alter von 15 Jahren (Lithographie 1835).jpg|thumb|right|19th-century composer and pianist [[Clara Schumann]].]]
Women have played a major role in music throughout history, as composers, songwriters, [[Musician|instrumental performers]], singers, conductors, [[musicology|music scholars]], [[music teacher|music educators]], [[music criticism|music critics]]/[[music journalist]]s and other musical professions. As well, it describes music movements, events and genres related to women, [[women's rights|women's issues]] and [[feminism]]. In the 2010s, while women comprise a significant proportion of [[popular music]] and classical music singers, and a significant proportion of songwriters (many of them being singer-songwriters), there are few women record producers, [[music journalist|rock critics]] and rock instrumentalists. Although there have been a huge number of [[List of women composers|women composers]] in classical music, from the Medieval period to the present day, women composers are significantly underrepresented in the [[Western canon|commonly performed classical music repertoire]], music history textbooks and music encyclopedias; for example, in the ''Concise Oxford History of Music'', [[Clara Schumann]] is one of the only female composers who is mentioned.

Women comprise a significant proportion of instrumental soloists in classical music and the percentage of women in orchestras is increasing. A 2015 article on concerto soloists in major Canadian orchestras, however, indicated that 84% of the soloists with the [[Orchestre Symphonique de Montreal]] were men. In 2012, women still made up just 6% of the top-ranked [[Vienna Philharmonic]] orchestra. Women are less common as instrumental players in popular music genres such as rock and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], although there have been a number of notable female instrumentalists and [[all-female band]]s. Women are particularly underrepresented in [[extreme metal]] genres.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Schaap and Pauwke Berkers. "Grunting Alone? Online Gender Inequality in Extreme Metal Music" in ''Journal of the International Association for the Study of Popular Music''. Vol. 4, no. 1 (2014) p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s pop-music scene, "[l]ike most aspects of the...music business, [in the 1960s,] songwriting was a male-dominated field. Though there were plenty of female singers on the radio, women ...were primarily seen as consumers:... Singing was sometimes an acceptable pastime for a girl, but playing an instrument, writing songs, or producing records simply wasn't done."&lt;ref name="rebeatmag.com"&gt;{{cite web |author=Erika White |url=http://www.rebeatmag.com/music-history-primer-3-pioneering-female-songwriters-of-the-60s/ |title=Music History Primer: 3 Pioneering Female Songwriters of the '60s &amp;#124; REBEAT Magazine |publisher=Rebeatmag.com |date=2015-01-28 |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young women "...were not socialized to see themselves as people who create [music]."&lt;ref name="rebeatmag.com"/&gt;

Women are also underrepresented in orchestral conducting, music criticism/music journalism, [[Music producer|music producing]], and [[sound engineering]]. While women were discouraged from composing in the 19th century, and there are few women [[musicology|musicologists]], women became involved in [[music education]] "...to such a degree that women dominated [this field] during the later half of the 19th century and well into the 20th century."&lt;ref name="parlorsongs.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://parlorsongs.com/issues/2002-9/thismonth/feature.php |title=Women Composers In American Popular Song |page= 1 |publisher=Parlorsongs.com |date=1911-03-25 |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jessica Duchen, a music writer for London's ''[[The Independent]]'', women musicians in classical music are "...too often judged for their appearances, rather than their talent" and they face pressure "...to look sexy onstage and in photos."&lt;ref name="music.cbc.ca"&gt;http://music.cbc.ca/#!/blogs/2014/3/Classical-musics-shocking-gender-gap {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160301002442/http://music.cbc.ca/ |date=2016-03-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Duchen states that while "[t]here are women musicians who refuse to play on their looks,...the ones who do tend to be more materially successful."&lt;ref name="music.cbc.ca"/&gt;
According to the UK's Radio 3 editor, Edwina Wolstencroft, the music industry has long been open to having women in performance or entertainment roles, but women are much less likely to have positions of authority, such as being the [[Conducting|leader of an orchestra]].&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;{{cite news |author=Jessica Duchen |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/feb/28/why-male-domination-of-classical-music-might-end |title=Why the male domination of classical music might be coming to an end &amp;#124; Music |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In popular music, while there are many women singers recording songs, there are very few women behind the [[Audio mixer|audio console]] acting as music producers, the individuals who direct and manage the recording process.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ncube |first=Rosina |title=Sounding Off: Why So Few Women In Audio? |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/sep13/articles/sounding-off-0913.htm |journal=Sound on Sound |date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most recorded artists is [[Asha Bhosle]], an Indian singer best known as a playback singer in Hindi cinema.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

==Media and technology==
{{Further|Computer music|Music technology}}

[[File:Peter Francken in his studio.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Music production in the 2000s using a [[digital audio workstation]] (DAW) with an electronic keyboard and a [[multi-monitor]] set-up]]
The music that composers and songwriters make can be heard through several media; the most traditional way is to hear it live, in the presence of the musicians (or as one of the musicians), in an outdoor or indoor space such as an amphitheatre, [[concert hall]], [[cabaret]] room, [[theatre music|theatre]], pub, or coffeehouse. Since the 20th century, live music can also be broadcast over the radio, television or the Internet, or [[sound recording|recorded]] and listened to on a [[CD player]] or Mp3 player. 

Some musical styles focus on producing songs and pieces for a live performance, while others focus on producing a recording that mixes together sounds that were never played "live." Even in essentially live styles such as rock, recording engineers often use the ability to [[Multitrack recording|edit, splice and mix]] to produce recordings that may be considered "better" than the actual live performance. For example, some singers record themselves singing a melody and then record multiple harmony parts using overdubbing, creating a sound that would be impossible to do live.

[[Music technology|Technology]] has had an influence on music since prehistoric times, when cave people used simple tools to bore holes into bone flutes 41,000 years ago. Technology continued to influence music throughout the history of music, as it enabled new instruments and music notation reproduction systems to be used, with one of the watershed moments in music notation being the invention of the [[printing press]] in the 1400s, which meant music scores no longer had to be hand copied. In the 19th century, music technology led to the development of a more powerful, louder piano and led to the development of new valves brass instruments. 

In the early 20th century (in the late 1920s), as [[sound film|talking pictures]] emerged in the early 20th century, with their prerecorded musical tracks, an increasing number of moviehouse orchestra musicians found themselves out of work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.afm.org/public/about/history.php |title=American Federation of Musicians/History |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070405035855/http://www.afm.org/public/about/history.php |archivedate=2007-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1920s, live musical performances by orchestras, pianists, and [[theater organ]]ists were common at first-run theaters.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard (1985), p. 429.{{incomplete short citation|date=July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the coming of the talking motion pictures, those featured performances were largely eliminated. The [[American Federation of Musicians]] (AFM) took out newspaper advertisements protesting the replacement of live musicians with mechanical playing devices. One 1929 ad that appeared in the ''[[Pittsburgh Press]]'' features an image of a can labeled "Canned Music / Big Noise Brand / Guaranteed to Produce No Intellectual or Emotional Reaction Whatever"&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.duke.edu/digitalcollections/adaccess.R0206/ "Canned Music on Trial"] part of [[Duke University]]'s ''Ad*Access'' project.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since legislation introduced to help protect performers, composers, publishers and producers, including the [[Audio Home Recording Act]] of 1992 in the United States, and the 1979 revised [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works]] in the United Kingdom, recordings and live performances have also become more accessible through computers, devices and Internet in a form that is commonly known as [[Music-On-Demand]].

In many cultures, there is less distinction between performing and listening to music, since virtually everyone is involved in some sort of musical activity, often in a communal setting. In industrialized countries, listening to music through a recorded form, such as [[Sound recording and reproduction|sound recording]] on record or radio became more common than experiencing live performance, roughly in the middle of the 20th century. By the 1980s, watching a [[music video]]s was a popular way to listen to music, while also seeing the performers.

Sometimes, live performances incorporate prerecorded sounds. For example, a [[disc jockey]] uses [[gramophone record|disc records]] for [[scratching]], and some 20th-century works have a solo for an instrument or voice that is performed along with music that is prerecorded onto a tape. Some pop bands use recorded [[backing tracks]]. Computers and many [[keyboard (computing)|keyboards]] can be programmed to produce and play [[Musical Instrument Digital Interface]] (MIDI) music. Audiences can also ''become'' performers by participating in [[karaoke]], an activity of Japanese origin centered on a device that plays voice-eliminated versions of well-known songs. Most karaoke machines also have video screens that show lyrics to songs being performed; performers can follow the lyrics as they sing over the instrumental tracks.

===Internet===

The advent of the Internet and widespread high-speed broadband access has transformed the experience of music, partly through the increased ease of access to recordings of music via [[streaming video]] and vastly increased choice of music for consumers. [[Chris Anderson (writer)|Chris Anderson]], in his book ''[[The Long Tail: Why the Future of Business Is Selling Less of More]]'', suggests that while the traditional economic model of [[supply and demand]] describes scarcity, the Internet retail model is based on abundance. [[Data storage device|Digital storage]] costs are low, so a company can afford to make its whole recording inventory available online, giving customers as much choice as possible. It has thus become economically viable to offer music recordings that very few people are interested in. Consumers' growing awareness of their increased choice results in a closer association between listening tastes and social identity, and the creation of thousands of [[niche market]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Chris (2006). The Long Tail: Why the Future of Business is Selling Less of More. Hyperion. {{ISBN|1-4013-0237-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another effect of the Internet arose with [[Virtual community|online communities]] and [[social media]] websites like YouTube and Facebook, a [[social networking service]]. These sites make it easier for aspiring singers and amateur bands to distribute videos of their songs, connect with other musicians, and gain audience interest. Professional musicians also use YouTube as a free publisher of promotional material. YouTube users, for example, no longer only download and listen to MP3s, but also actively create their own. According to [[Don Tapscott]] and [[Anthony D. Williams (author)|Anthony D. Williams]], in their book ''[[Wikinomics]]'', there has been a shift from a traditional consumer role to what they call a "[[prosumer]]" role, a consumer who both creates content and consumes. Manifestations of this in music include the production of [[mashup (music)|mashes]], [[remix]]es, and music videos by fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tapscott |first=Don |authorlink=Don Tapscott |author2=Williams, Anthony D. |authorlink2=Anthony D.

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business==
[[File:Concerto music store, Utrechtsestraat 64, Amsterdam 5.jpg|350px|thumb|right|A music store selling various singles and albums]]
{{Main|Music industry}}

The music industry refers to the businesses connected with the creation and sale of music. It consists of songwriters and composers who create new songs and musical pieces, music producers and [[sound engineer]]s who record songs and pieces, record labels and [[Music publisher (popular music)|publishers]] that distribute recorded music products and [[sheet music]] internationally and that often control the rights to those products. Some music labels are "[[independent record label|independent]]," while others are subsidiaries of larger corporate entities or international [[media conglomerate|media groups]]. In the 2000s, the increasing popularity of listening to music as digital music files on MP3 players, iPods, or computers, and of trading music on [[file sharing]] websites or buying it online in the form of digital files had a major impact on the traditional music business. Many smaller independent [[CD store]]s went out of business as music buyers decreased their purchases of CDs, and many labels had lower CD sales. Some companies did well with the change to a digital format, though, such as Apple's [[iTunes]], an [[online music store]] that sells digital files of songs over the Internet.

===Intellectual property laws===
{{Main||Royalty_payment#Music_royalties}}
In spite of some [[international copyright treaties]], determining which music is in the [[public domain]] is complicated by [[:Category:copyright law by country|the variety]] of national [[copyright law]]s that may be applicable.  [[US copyright law]] formerly protected printed music published after 1923 for 28 years and with renewal for another 28 years, but the [[Copyright Act of 1976]] made renewal automatic, and the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] changed the calculation of the copyright term to 70 years after the death of the creator. Recorded sound falls under [[mechanical licensing]], often covered by a confusing patchwork of state laws; most [[cover version]]s are licensed through the [[Harry Fox Agency]]. [[Performance rights]] may be obtained by either performers or the performance venue; the two major organizations for licensing are [[Broadcast Music, Inc.|BMI]] and [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers|ASCAP]]. Two online sources for [[public domain music]] are [[International Music Score Library Project|IMSLP (International Music Score Library Project)]] and [[Choral Public Domain Library|Choral Public Domain Library (CPDL)]].

==Education==

===Non-professional===
{{Main|Music education}}
[[File:Suzuki violin recital.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|A [[Suzuki method|Suzuki]] violin recital with students of varying ages]]
The incorporation of some music or singing training into general education from [[Preschool education|preschool]] to [[Higher education|post secondary education]] is common in North America and Europe. Involvement in playing and singing music is thought to teach basic skills such as concentration, [[counting]], listening, and cooperation while also promoting understanding of [[language]], improving the ability to [[memory|recall]] information, and creating an environment more conducive to learning in other areas.&lt;ref&gt;Woodall and Ziembroski, 2002{{incomplete short citation|date=July 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; In elementary schools, children often learn to play instruments such as the [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]], sing in small choirs, and learn about the history of Western art music and traditional music. Some elementary school children also learn about popular music styles. In religious schools, children sing [[hymn]]s and other religious music. In secondary schools (and less commonly in elementary schools), students may have the opportunity to perform in some types of musical ensembles, such as [[choir]]s (a group of singers), [[marching band]]s, [[concert band]]s, jazz bands, or orchestras. In some school systems, music lessons on how to play instruments may be provided. Some students also take private [[music lesson]]s after school with a singing teacher or instrument teacher. Amateur musicians typically learn basic musical rudiments (e.g., learning about [[musical notation]] for [[musical scale]]s and rhythms) and beginner- to intermediate-level singing or instrument-playing techniques.

At the university level, students in most arts and [[humanities]] programs can receive [[Credit (education)|credit]] for taking a few music courses, which typically take the form of an overview course on the [[history of music]], or a [[music appreciation]] course that focuses on listening to music and learning about different musical styles. In addition, most North American and European universities have some types of musical ensembles that students in arts and humanities are able to participate in, such as choirs, marching bands, concert bands, or orchestras. The study of Western art music is increasingly common outside of North America and Europe, such as the [[Indonesian Institute of the Arts, Yogyakarta|Indonesian Institute of the Arts]] in [[Yogyakarta (city)|Yogyakarta]], [[Indonesia]], or the classical music programs that are available in Asian countries such as South Korea, Japan, and China. At the same time, Western universities and colleges are widening their curriculum to include music of non-Western cultures, such as the [[music of Africa]] or Bali (e.g. [[Gamelan]] music).

===Professional training===

Individuals aiming to become professional musicians, singers, composers, songwriters, music teachers and practitioners of other music-related professions such as [[music history]] professors, [[sound engineer]]s, and so on study in specialized post-secondary programs offered by colleges, universities and [[music conservatory|music conservatories]].  Some institutions that train individuals for careers in music offer training in a wide range of professions, as is the case with many of the top U.S. universities, which offer degrees in music performance (including singing and playing instruments), music history, music theory, music composition, [[music education]] (for individuals aiming to become elementary or high school music teachers) and, in some cases, conducting. On the other hand, some small colleges may only offer training in a single profession (e.g., [[sound recording]]).

While most university and conservatory music programs focus on training students in classical music, there are a number of universities and colleges that train musicians for careers as [[jazz]] or [[popular music]] musicians and composers, with notable U.S. examples including the [[Manhattan School of Music]] and the [[Berklee College of Music]]. Two important schools in Canada which offer professional jazz training are [[McGill University]] and [[Humber College]]. Individuals aiming at careers in some types of music, such as [[heavy metal music]], [[country music]] or [[blues]] are less likely to become professionals by completing degrees or diplomas in colleges or universities. Instead, they typically learn about their style of music by singing and/or playing in many bands (often beginning in amateur bands, [[cover band]]s and [[tribute band]]s), studying recordings available on CD, DVD and the Internet and working with already-established professionals in their style of music, either through informal [[mentoring]] or regular [[music lesson]]s. Since the 2000s, the increasing popularity and availability of Internet forums and YouTube "how-to" videos have enabled many singers and musicians from metal, blues and similar genres to improve their skills. Many pop, rock and country singers train informally with [[vocal coach]]es and [[singing teacher]]s.

====Undergraduate====
[[Undergraduate education|Undergraduate]] [[academic degree|university degrees]] in music, including the [[Bachelor of Music]], the Bachelor of Music Education, and the Bachelor of Arts (with a major in music) typically take about four years to complete. These degrees provide students with a grounding in music theory and music history, and many students also study an instrument or learn singing technique as part of their program. Graduates of undergraduate music programs can seek employment or go on to further study in music graduate programs. Bachelor's degree graduates are also eligible to apply to some graduate programs and [[professional school]]s outside of music (e.g., [[public administration]], [[business administration]], [[library science]], and, in some jurisdictions, [[teachers college|teacher's college]], [[law school]] or [[medical school]]).

====Graduate====
Graduate music degrees include the [[Master of Music]], the Master of Arts (in musicology, music theory or another music field), the Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) (e.g., in musicology or music theory), and more recently, the [[Doctor of Musical Arts]], or DMA. The Master of Music degree, which takes one to two years to complete, is typically awarded to students studying the performance of an instrument, education, voice (singing) or composition. The Master of Arts degree, which takes one to two years to complete and often requires a [[Dissertation|thesis]], is typically awarded to students studying musicology, music history, music theory or ethnomusicology.

The PhD, which is required for students who want to work as university professors in musicology, music history, or music theory, takes three to five years of study after the master's degree, during which time the student will complete advanced courses and undertake research for a dissertation. The DMA is a relatively new degree that was created to provide a credential for professional performers or composers that want to work as university professors in musical performance or composition. The DMA takes three to five years after a master's degree, and includes advanced courses, projects, and performances. In Medieval times, the study of music was one of the [[Quadrivium]] of the seven [[liberal arts|Liberal Arts]] and considered vital to higher learning. Within the quantitative Quadrivium, music, or more accurately [[harmonic]]s, was the study of rational proportions.

====Musicology====
[[Musicology]], the academic study of the subject of music, is studied in universities and music conservatories. The earliest definitions from the 19th century defined three sub-disciplines of musicology: [[systematic musicology]], [[Music history|historical musicology]], and comparative musicology or [[ethnomusicology]]. In 2010-era scholarship, one is more likely to encounter a division of the discipline into [[music theory]], [[music history]], and [[ethnomusicology]]. Research in musicology has often been enriched by cross-disciplinary work, for example in the field of [[psychoacoustics]]. The study of music of non-Western cultures, and the cultural study of music, is called ethnomusicology. Students can pursue the undergraduate study of musicology, ethnomusicology, [[music history]], and music theory through several different types of degrees, including bachelor's degrees, master's degrees and PhD degrees.

====Music theory====
[[Music theory]] is the study of music, generally in a highly technical manner outside of other disciplines. More broadly it refers to any study of music, usually related in some form with compositional concerns, and may include [[mathematics]], [[physics]], and [[anthropology]]. What is most commonly taught in beginning music theory classes are guidelines to write in the style of the [[common practice period]], or [[Tonality|tonal music]]. Theory, even of music of the common practice period, may take many other forms. [[Set theory (music)|Musical set theory]] is the application of mathematical [[set theory]] to music, first applied to [[Atonality|atonal music]]. ''Speculative music theory'', contrasted with ''analytic music theory'', is devoted to the analysis and synthesis of music materials, for example [[musical tuning|tuning systems]], generally as preparation for composition.

====Zoomusicology====
[[Zoomusicology]] is the study of the music of non-human animals, or the musical aspects of sounds produced by non-human animals. As George Herzog (1941) asked, "do animals have music?" [[François-Bernard Mâche]]'s ''Musique, mythe, nature, ou les Dauphins d'Arion'' (1983), a study of "ornitho-musicology" using a technique of [[Nicolas Ruwet]]'s ''Langage&lt;!--Langage=parlance or mode of speech--&gt;, musique, poésie'' (1972) [[Paradigmatic analysis|paradigmatic segmentation analysis]], shows that [[Bird vocalization|bird songs]] are organised according to a repetition-transformation principle. Jean-Jacques Nattiez (1990), argues that "in the last analysis, it is a human being who decides what is and is not musical, even when the sound is not of human origin. If we acknowledge that sound is not organised and conceptualised (that is, made to form music) merely by its producer, but by the mind that perceives it, then music is uniquely human."

====Ethnomusicology====
{{Main|Ethnomusicology}}
[[File:Frances Densmore recording Mountain Chief2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Ethnomusicologist [[Frances Densmore]] recording [[Blackfoot]] chief Mountain Chief for the [[Bureau of American Ethnology]] (1916)]]
In the West, much of the history of music that is taught deals with the Western civilization's art music, which is known as classical music. The history of music in non-Western cultures ("[[world music]]" or the field of "ethnomusicology"), which typically covers music from
Africa and Asia is also taught in Western universities. This includes the documented classical traditions of Asian countries outside the influence of Western Europe, as well as the folk or indigenous music of various other cultures. Popular or folk styles of music in non-Western countries varied widely from culture to culture, and from period to period. Different cultures emphasised different [[musical instrument|instruments]], techniques, singing styles and uses for music. Music has been used for entertainment, ceremonies, rituals, religious purposes and for practical and artistic communication. Non-Western music has also been used for propaganda purposes, as was the case with [[Chinese opera]] during the [[Cultural Revolution]].

There is a host of music classifications for non-Western music, many of which are caught up in the argument over the [[definition of music]]. Among the largest of these is the division between classical music (or "art" music), and popular music (or [[Contemporary commercial music|commercial music]] – including non-Western styles of rock, [[country music|country]], and pop music-related styles). Some genres do not fit neatly into one of these "big two" classifications, (such as [[folk music]], [[world music]], or [[jazz]]-related music).

As world cultures have come into [[Globalization|greater global contact]], their indigenous musical styles have often merged with other styles, which produces new styles. For example, the United States [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] style contains elements from [[Folk Music of England|Anglo]]-[[Music of Ireland|Irish]], [[Music of Scotland|Scottish]], Irish, [[Music of Germany|German]] and African instrumental and vocal traditions, which were able to fuse in the United States' multi-ethnic "[[melting pot]]" society. Some types of world music contain a mixture of non-Western indigenous styles with Western pop music elements. Genres of music are determined as much by tradition and presentation as by the actual music. Some works, like [[George Gershwin]]'s ''[[Rhapsody in Blue]]'', are claimed by both jazz and classical music, while Gershwin's ''[[Porgy and Bess]]'' and [[Leonard Bernstein]]'s ''[[West Side Story (musical)|West Side Story]]'' are claimed by both opera and the [[Broadway musical]] tradition. Many current music festivals for non-Western music include bands and singers from a particular musical genre, such as world music.

[[Music of India|Indian music]], for example, is one of the oldest and longest living types of music, and is still widely heard and performed in South Asia, as well as internationally (especially since the 1960s). Indian music has mainly three forms of classical music, [[Hindustani classical music|Hindustani]], [[Carnatic music|Carnatic]], and [[Dhrupad]] styles. It has also a large repertoire of styles, which involve only percussion music such as the talavadya performances famous in [[South India]].

==Music therapy==
{{Main|Music therapy}}
[[File:USMC-05376.jpg|thumb|right|A music therapist from a "Blues in the Schools" program plays harmonica with a US Navy sailor at a Naval Therapy Center.]]
[[Music therapy]] is an interpersonal process in which a trained therapist uses music and all of its facets—physical, emotional, mental, social, aesthetic, and spiritual—to help clients to improve or maintain their health. In some instances, the client's needs are addressed directly through music; in others they are addressed through the relationships that develop between the client and therapist. Music therapy is used with individuals of all ages and with a variety of conditions, including: psychiatric disorders, medical problems, physical disabilities, sensory impairments, developmental disabilities, substance abuse issues, communication disorders, interpersonal problems, and aging. It is also used to improve learning, build self-esteem, reduce stress, [[Exercise and music|support physical exercise]], and facilitate a host of other health-related activities. Music therapists may encourage clients to sing, play instruments, create songs, or do other musical activities.

One of the earliest mentions of music therapy was in [[Al-Farabi]]'s (c. 872–950) treatise ''Meanings of the Intellect'', which described the therapeutic effects of music on the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Haque |first1=Amber |year=2004 |title=Psychology from Islamic Perspective: Contributions of Early Muslim Scholars and Challenges to Contemporary Muslim Psychologists |url= |journal=Journal of Religion and Health |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=357–377 [363] |doi=10.1007/s10943-004-4302-z}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=May 2011}} Music has long been used to help people deal with their emotions. In the 17th century, the scholar [[Robert Burton (scholar)|Robert Burton]]'s ''[[The Anatomy of Melancholy]]'' argued that music and dance were critical in treating [[Mental disorder|mental illness]], especially [[melancholia]].&lt;ref&gt;cf. The Anatomy of Melancholy, Robert Burton, subsection 3, on and after line 3,480, "Music a Remedy"&lt;/ref&gt; He noted that music has an "excellent power ...to expel many other diseases" and he called it "a sovereign remedy against despair and melancholy." He pointed out that in Antiquity, Canus, a Rhodian fiddler, used music to "make a melancholy man merry, ...a lover more enamoured, a religious man more devout."&lt;ref&gt;Ismenias the Theban, Chiron the centaur, is said to have cured this and many other diseases by music alone: as now thy do those, saith Bodine, that are

[[Albert Einstein]] had a lifelong love of music (particularly the works of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gci.org.uk/Documents/einstein&amp;music.pdf |title=Einstein and his love of music |last=Foster |first=Brian |magazine=Physics World |date=2005 |accessdate=August 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; once stating that life without playing music would be inconceivable to him. In some interviews Einstein even attributed much of his scientific intuition to music, with his son Hans recounting that "whenever he felt that he had come to the end of the road or into a difficult situation in his work, he would take refuge in music, and that would usually resolve all his difficulties." Something in the music, according to Michele and Robert Root-Bernstein in ''[[Psychology Today]]'', "would guide his thoughts in new and creative directions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/imagine/201003/einstein-creative-thinking-music-and-the-intuitive-art-scientific-imagination |title=Einstein On Creative Thinking: Music and the Intuitive Art of Scientific Imagination|author1-last=Root-Bernstein|author1-first=Michele|author2-last=Root-Bernstein|author2-first=Robert |magazine=Psychology Today |date=March 31, 2010 |accessdate=August 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been said that Einstein considered Mozart's music to reveal a universal harmony that Einstein believed existed in the universe, "as if the great Wolfgang Amadeus did not 'create' his beautifully clear music at all, but simply discovered it already made. This perspective parallels, remarkably, Einstein’s views on the ultimate simplicity of nature and its explanation and statement via essentially simple mathematical expressions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.openculture.com/2013/06/the_musical_mind_of_albert_einstein.html |title=The Musical Mind of Albert Einstein: Great Physicist, Amateur Violinist and Devotee of Mozart |website=Open Culture |date=June 25, 2013 |accessdate=August 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review suggests that music may be effective for improving subjective sleep quality in adults with insomnia symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Jesperson |first=Kira |date=13 August 2015 |title=Music for insomnia in adults |journal=[[Cochrane Library]]|volume= |issue=8 |pages= CD010459|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD010459.pub2 |pmid=26270746 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Music is also being used in clinical rehabilitation of cognitive and motor disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/322792.php|title=Why does bass make you want to dance?|work=Medical News Today|access-date=2018-08-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In principle, anything that somehow produces [[sound]] can serve as a musical instrument, but the term is generally reserved for items having this specific purpose.''

&lt;!--This is so that those interested in the subject can monitor changes to the pages by clicking on [[Special:Recentchangeslinked/Index of music articles|Related Changes]] in the sidebar and on the bottom of the page. [[Index of music articles|This page links to itself]], so we can track changes to it, too. If you want to create articles about music, consult the [[Wikipedia:Requested articles/music|list of requested articles about music]].

This list is not necessarily complete or up to date - if you see an article that should be here but isn't (or one that shouldn't be here but is), please update the page accordingly. Do note, however, that there is already  a [[list of musical instruments]], a [[list of musical instruments by Hornbostel-Sachs number]], a [[list of musical ensembles]], and similar lists exist at [[composer]], [[musician]], [[record producer]]s, [[arranger]], [[list of genres of music]], &amp; [[list of record labels]]. --&gt;

      <text bytes="6638" xml:space="preserve">{{Short description|Legal foundation for Nuremberg Trials}}

The '''Charter of the International Military Tribunal – Annex to the Agreement for the prosecution and punishment of the major war criminals of the European Axis''' (usually referred to as the '''Nuremberg Charter''' or '''London Charter''') was the decree issued by the [[European Advisory Commission]] on 8 August 1945 that set down the rules and procedures by which the [[Nuremberg trials]] were to be conducted.

The charter stipulated that crimes of the European [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis Powers]] could be tried. Three categories of crimes were defined: [[crimes against peace]], [[war crime]]s, and [[crimes against humanity]]. Article 8 of the charter also stated that holding an official position was no defense to war crimes. [[Nuremberg Defense|Obedience to orders]] could only be considered in mitigation of punishment if the Tribunal determined that justice so required.

The [[criminal procedure]] used by the Tribunal was closer to [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] than to [[common law]], with a trial before a panel of judges rather than a [[jury trial]] and with wide allowance for [[hearsay]] evidence. Defendants who were found guilty could [[appeal]] the verdict to the [[Allied Control Council]]. In addition, they would be permitted to present evidence in their defense and to [[cross-examination|cross-examine]] witnesses.

The Charter was developed by the European Advisory Commission under the authority of the [[Moscow Declaration#Statement on Atrocities|Moscow Declaration: Statement on Atrocities]], which was agreed at the [[Moscow Conference (1943)]]. It was drawn up in London, following the surrender of Germany on [[VE Day]]. It was drafted by [[Robert H. Jackson]], [[Robert Falco]], and [[Iona Nikitchenko]] of the European Advisory Commission and issued on 8 August 1945.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/3ae6b39614.html Charter of the International Military Tribunal - Annex to the Agreement for the prosecution and punishment of the major war criminals of the European Axis]. United Nations Refugee Agency&lt;/ref&gt;

The Charter and its definition of crimes against peace was also the basis of the [[Finland|Finnish]] law, approved by the [[Parliament of Finland|Finnish parliament]] on 11 September 1945, that enabled the [[war-responsibility trials in Finland]].

The Agreement for the prosecution and punishment of the major war criminals of the European Axis and the annexed Charter were formally signed by [[Provisional Government of the French Republic|France]], the [[Soviet Union]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[United States]] on 8 August 1945. The Agreement and Charter were subsequently ratified by 20 other Allied states.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/applic/ihl/ihl.nsf/States.xsp?xp_viewStates=XPages_NORMStatesParties&amp;xp_treatySelected=350 Ratifications], [https://treaties.un.org/pages/showDetails.aspx?objid=08000002801572a2 United Nations Treaty Series, vol. 82].&lt;/ref&gt;

Most allegations involve [[human rights abuse]]s and [[crimes against humanity]].

==History==
Many countries have been plagued by [[revolution]]s, [[coups]] and [[civil war]]. After such turmoil the leaders of the outgoing regime that want, or are forced, to restore democracy in their country are confronted with possible litigation regarding the "[[counterinsurgency]]" actions taken during their reign. It is not uncommon for people to make allegations of [[human rights abuse]] and [[crimes against humanity]]. To overcome the hazard of facing prosecution, many countries have absolved those involved of their alleged crimes.

Amnesty laws are often also equally problematic to the opposing side as a cost-benefit problem: Is bringing the old leadership to justice worth extending the conflict or rule of the previous regime, with an accompanying increase in suffering and casualties, as the old regime refuses to let go of power?

Victims, their families and [[human rights]] organisations—''e.g.,'' [[Amnesty International]], [[Human Rights Watch]], [[Humanitarian Law Project]]—have opposed such laws through [[Madres de la Plaza de Mayo|demonstrations]] and litigation, their argument being that an amnesty law violates local [[constitutional law]] and [[international law]] by upholding [[impunity]].

Providing [[amnesty]] for “international crimes”—which include [[crimes against humanity]], [[war crimes]] and [[genocide]]—is increasingly considered to be prohibited by [[international law]]. This understanding is drawn from the obligations set out in [[human rights]] [[treaties]], the decisions of international and regional courts and the law emerging from long-standing state practice (customary international law). International, regional and national courts have increasingly overturned general amnesties. And recent peace agreements have largely avoided granting amnesty for serious crimes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ictj.org/publication/pursuing-peace-justice-or-both "Pursuing Peace, Justice or Both?"], ''[[International Center for Transitional Justice]] (ICTJ)''&lt;/ref&gt; With that in mind, the [[International Criminal Court]] was established to ensure that perpetrators do not evade [[command responsibility]] for their crimes should the local government fail to prosecute.

The [[Belfast Guidelines on Amnesty and Accountability]] set out a framework to evaluate the legality and legitimacy of amnesties in accordance with the multiple legal obligations faced by states undergoing conflict or political transition.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.transitionaljustice.ulster.ac.uk/TransitionalJusticeInstitute.htmAmnestyGuidelinesProject.htm&lt;/ref&gt; They have been collectively authored by a group of international human rights and conflict resolution experts led by Louise Mallinder and Tom Hadden at the [[Transitional Justice Institute]].

Afghanistan has adopted a law precluding prosecution for war crimes committed in conflicts in previous decades.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insight/articles/pp0317.7.shtml AFGHANISTAN: AMNESTY LAW DRAWS CRITICISM, PRAISE] by Ron Synovitz, [[EurasiaNet]], 3/17/07&lt;/ref&gt;

The Afghan government adopted the Action Plan for Peace, Justice, and Reconciliation in December 2005, and hotly debated the plan's focus on criminal [[accountability]]. Later, Parliament adopted a bill that provided a nearly blanket [[amnesty]] for all those involved in the Afghan conflict.

The drafting of the amnesty bill was pioneered by some of the former commanders known to have committed [[human rights]] abuses and who felt threatened by the sudden emphasis on accountability. 
Although this bill was never formally recognized as law, it has had major political significance, serving as a clear signal of some human rights violators’ continuing power.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ictj.org/publication/transitional-justice-context-ongoing-conflict-case-afghanistan "Transitional Justice in the Context of Ongoing Conflict: the Case of Afghanistan"] by Sari Kouvo, ''[[International Center for Transitional Justice]] (ICTJ)''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Argentina===

The [[Comisión Nacional sobre la Desaparición de Personas|National Commission for Forced Disappearances]] (CONADEP), led by writer [[Ernesto Sabato]], was created in 1983. Two years later, the ''[[Juicio a las Juntas]]'' (Trial of the Juntas) largely succeeded in proving the crimes of the various ''juntas'' which had formed the self-styled [[National Reorganization Process]]. Most of the top officers who were tried were sentenced to [[life imprisonment]]: [[Jorge Rafael Videla]], [[Emilio Eduardo Massera]], [[Roberto Eduardo Viola]], [[Armando Lambruschini]], [[Raúl Agosti]], [[Rubén Graffigna]], [[Leopoldo Galtieri]], [[Jorge Anaya]] and [[Basilio Lami Dozo]]. However, [[Raúl Alfonsín]]'s government voted two [[amnesty]] laws in order to avoid the escalation of trials against militaries involved in human rights abuses: the 1986 ''[[Ley de Punto Final]]'' and the 1987 ''[[Ley de Obediencia Debida]]''. President [[Carlos Menem]] then [[pardon]]ed the leaders of the ''junta'' and the surviving commanders of the armed leftist guerrilla organizations in 1989–1990. Following persistent activism by the [[Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo]] and other associations, the amnesty laws were overturned by the [[Supreme Court of Argentina|Argentine Supreme Court]] nearly twenty years later, in June 2005. However, the ruling wasn't applied to the guerrilla leaders, who remained at large.

===Benin===
In the 1980s, incompetent economic management and ballooning domestic graft, including the draining of funds from parastatals, combined with a continent-wide economic crisis, effectively bankrupted the economy. The government turned to the Bretton Woods institutions for support, which required the implementation of unpopular economic austerity measures. In 1988, when France refused to meet the budgetary shortfall, the three main banks, all state-owned, collapsed and the government was unable to pay teachers, civil servants and soldiers their salaries, nor students their grants. This caused domestic opposition to mushroom, rendering the country ‘virtually ungovernable’.20 The World Bank and the InternationalMonetary Fund (IMF) refused to provide emergency assistance because of Benin's failure to adhere to prior agreements.21 Kérékou convened a national conference to discuss the country's future course, bringing together representatives of all sectors of Beninese society, including ‘teachers, students, the military, government officials, religious authorities, non-governmental organizations, more than 50 political parties, ex-presidents, labor unions, business interests, farmers, and dozens of local development organizations’.22 Kérékou believed that he could retain control of the 488 delegates. Instead, when it met in February 1990, the convention declared itself sovereign, redefined the powers of the presidency, reducing Kérékou to a figurehead role, and appointed Nicéphore Soglo, a former World Bank staff member, to act as executive prime minister. In exchange for a full pardon for any crimes he may have committed, Kérékou peacefully ceded power. By March 1991, the Beninese electorate had ratified a new constitution and democratically elected Soglo president.&lt;ref&gt;From B. A. Magnusson, ‘Testing Democracy in Benin: Experiments in Institutional Reform’, in R Joseph (ed.), State, Conflict and Democracy in Africa, Boulder: Lynne Rienner, 1999, p 221.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brazil===
{{main|Operation Condor|History of Brazil}}

In 1979, [[Brazilian military government|Brazil's military dictatorship]]—which suppressed young [[political activists]] and trade unionists—passed an [[amnesty]] law. This law allowed exiled activists to return, but was also used to shield [[human rights]] violators from [[prosecution]]. Perpetrators of human rights abuses during Brazil's 1964 to 1985 military dictatorship have yet to face [[criminal justice]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ictj.org/our-work/regions-and-countries/brazil Brazil] ''[[International Center for Transitional Justice]] (ICTJ)''&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2010, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights declared Brazil's amnesty law illegal because of the provisions that “prevent the investigation and punishment of serious human rights violations” and ordered the nation to begin exploring the gross human rights violations of the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Filho|first=Paulo Coelho|title=Truth Commission in Brazil: Individualizing Amnesty, Revealing the Truth|journal=The Yale Review of International Studies|date=Feb 2012|url=http://yris.yira.org/essays/440|accessdate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
On April 9, 2014, a bill (#237/2013) that would modify this law to exclude human rights violations committed by state agents was approved by the Brazilian senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sardinha |first=Edson |title=Comissão aprova revisão da Lei da Anistia |url=http://www.brasildefato.com.br/node/28096 |accessdate=April 11, 2014 |newspaper=Brasil de Fato |date=April 10, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502032618/http://www.brasildefato.com.br/node/28096 |archivedate=May 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chile===
{{main|1973 Chilean coup d'état|Operation Condor|U.S. intervention in Chile|National Commission on Political Imprisonment and Torture|National Truth and Reconciliation Commission|History of Chile}}

When [[Augusto Pinochet]] was arrested in London as part of a failed [[extradition]] to Spain, which was demanded by magistrate [[Baltasar Garzón]], a bit more information concerning Condor was revealed. One of the lawyers who asked for his extradition talked about an attempt to assassinate [[Carlos Altamirano]], leader of the [[Chilean Socialist Party]]: Pinochet would have met Italian terrorist [[Stefano Delle Chiaie]] in Madrid in 1975, during [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]'s funeral, in order to have him murdered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.derechos.org/sorin/doc/p2.html Las Relaciones Secretas entre Pinochet, Franco y la [[Propaganda Due|P2]] - Conspiracion para matar], [[Equipo Nizkor]], February 4, 1999 {{in lang|es}}&lt;/ref&gt; But as with [[Bernardo Leighton]], who was shot in Rome in 1975 after a meeting the same year in Madrid between Stefano Delle Chiaie, [[Michael Townley]] and anti-Castrist [[Virgilio Paz Romero]], the plan ultimately failed.

Chilean judge [[Juan Guzmán Tapia]] would eventually make [[jurisprudence]] concerning "permanent kidnapping" crime: since the bodies of the victims could not be found, he deemed that the kidnapping may be said to continue, therefore refusing to grant to the military the benefices of the statute of limitation. This helped indict Chilean militaries who were benefitting from a 1978 self-amnesty decree.

===Democratic Republic of the Congo===
{{main|First Congo War|Second Congo War|Democratic Republic of the Congo}}

In November 2005 an amnesty law was adopted regarding offences committed between August 1996 and June 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?reportid=57408 Amnesty law passed without MPs from Kabila's party] by IRIN, the humanitarian news and analysis service of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.&lt;/ref&gt;

President [[Joseph Kabila]] put an Amnesty Law into effect in May 2009. This law forgives combatants for war-related violence in the eastern provinces of North and South Kivu committed between June 2003 and May 2009 – excluding [[genocide]], [[war crimes]] international [[crimes against humanity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://africanpress.wordpress.com/2009/06/19/congo-drc-militias-decry-kivu-amnesty-law/ "Congo DRC: Militias decry Kivu amnesty law"]''African Press International (API)''&lt;/ref&gt; Although of limited temporal and geographic scope, by granting [[amnesty]] for many crimes perpetuated by [[rebel groups]], Congolese armed forces, [[militias]], and [[police]], there is a risk that the law may perpetuate the DRC's culture of [[impunity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ictj.org/publication/amnesty-must-not-equal-impunity "Amnesty Must Not Equal Impunity"]''[[International Center for Transitional Justice]] (ICTJ)''&lt;/ref&gt;

===England===

The [[Indemnity and Oblivion Act]] was passed in 1660, as part of rebuilding during the [[English Restoration]] after the [[English Civil War]]. It was jokingly referred to as producing "indemnity for the King's enemies and oblivion for the King's friends".

The so-called "[[Alan Turing law]]" is a proposed amnesty law for men convicted of consensual homosexual sex prior to the passing of the [[Sexual Offences Act 1967]]. The Government has announced that the amnesty will be introduced in [[England and Wales]] as an amendment to the [[Policing and Crime Bill 2016]].&lt;ref name="BBC-pardon"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-37711518|title='Alan Turing law': Thousands of gay men to be pardoned|date=20 October 2016|accessdate=20 October 2016|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lebanon===

An amnesty law for crimes perpetrated before March 28, 1991, was enacted in 1991&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.amnesty.org/library/index/engMDE180092005?open&amp;of=eng-LBN Lebanon: Mass Graves - Exhumations must be in line with international standards, and perpetrators brought to justice] by [[Amnesty International]], December 5, 2005 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070422121747/http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGMDE180092005?open&amp;of=ENG-LBN |date=April 22, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; after which the militias (with the important exception of [[Hezbollah]]) were dissolved, and the [[Lebanese Armed Forces]] began to slowly rebuild themselves as Lebanon's only major non-sectarian institution.

===Paraguay===

===Peru===
{{main|Internal conflict in Peru|Peruvian Constitutional Crisis of 1992}}

On 14 June 1995, President [[Alberto Fujimori]] signed a bill granting amnesty for any human rights abuses or other criminal acts committed from May 1982 to 14 June 1995 as part of the counterinsurgency war by military, police, and civilians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freelori.org/groups/nacla/95sep_nacla.html The New Amnesty Law in Peru] by [[NACLA Report on the Americas]] (Sept/Oct 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

The amnesty laws created a new challenge for the [[human rights]] movement in [[Peru]]. They thwarted the demands for [[truth]] and [[justice]] that thousands of family members of victims of [[political violence]] have been making since the 1980s. Thus, after the fall of [[Alberto Fujimori]] in 2001, the [[Inter-American Court]] ruled that the amnesty laws 26.479 and 26.492 were invalid because they were incompatible with the [[American Convention on Human Rights]]. The court later specified that the ruling was applicable to all Peruvian cases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ictj.org/publication/legacy-truth-criminal-justice-peruvian-transition The Legacy of Truth: Criminal Justice in the Peruvian Transition], ''[[International Center for Transitional Justice]] (ICTJ)''&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 July 1999, the "Lomé Peace Agreement" was signed. Along with a cease-fire agreement between the government of [[Alhaji Ahmad Tejan Kabbah]] and the [[Revolutionary United Front]] (RUF) it contained proposals to "expunge responsibility for all offences including international crimes, otherwise known as [[delict jus gentium]] such as crimes against humanity, war crimes, genocide, torture and other serious violations of international humanitarian law."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uni-potsdam.de/u/mrz/mrm/mrm13-1.htm Is the Sierra Leonean Amnesty Law Compatible with International Law?] by Phenyo Keiseng Rakate, MenschenRechtsMagazin Heft 3 / 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===
{{main|Apartheid|Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)}}

Following the end of [[apartheid]] [[South Africa]] decided not to prosecute but instead created the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] (TRC). Its aim was to investigate and elucidate the crimes committed during the apartheid regime while not indicting in an attempt to make the alleged perpetrators more compliant to cooperate.

The TRC offered of “amnesty for truth” to perpetrators of [[human rights abuses]] during the apartheid era. This enabled abusers to confess their actions to the TRC in order to be granted [[amnesty]]. It aroused much controversy in the country and internationally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ictj.org/our-work/regions-and-countries/south-africa South Africa], ''[[International Center for Transitional Justice]] (ICTJ)''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, the first democratic government elected after Franco's death passed the [[Law 46/1977, of amnesty]], which exempted of responsibility to everyone who committed any offence for political reasons prior to this date. This law allowed the commutation of sentences of those accused to attack the dictatorship and secured that those crimes committed during the Francoism would not be prosecuted.

===United States===
{{main|Military Commissions Act of 2006|War on Terror}}

During the [[War on Terror]], the [[United States]] enacted the [[Military Commissions Act of 2006]] in an attempt to regulate the legal procedures involving [[illegal combatant]]s. Part of the act was an amendment which retroactively rewrote the [[War Crimes Act of 1996|War Crimes Act]] effectively making [[Bush Doctrine|policy makers]] (i.e., [[George W. Bush administration|politicians]] and [[List of United States military leaders by rank|military leaders]]) and those [[Commanding officer|applying policy]] (i.e., [[CIA]] [[interrogation|interrogators]] and [[U.S. Army|U.S. soldiers]]) no longer subject to legal prosecution under U.S. law for acts defined as war crimes before the amendment was passed.&lt;ref&gt;No longer punishable under U.S. law

The Rome Statute established four core international crimes: [[genocide]], [[crimes against humanity]], [[war crime]]s, and the [[crime of aggression]]. Those crimes "shall not be subject to any [[statute of limitations]]".&lt;ref&gt;Article 29, Non-applicability of statute of limitations&lt;/ref&gt; Under the Rome Statute, the ICC can only investigate and prosecute the four core international crimes in situations where states are "unable" or "unwilling" to do so themselves; the jurisdiction of the court is complementary to jurisdictions of domestic courts. The court has jurisdiction over crimes only if they are committed in the territory of a state party or if they are committed by a national of a state party; an exception to this rule is that the ICC may also have jurisdiction over crimes if its jurisdiction is authorized by the [[United Nations Security Council]].

==Purpose==

The Rome Statute established four core international crimes: (I) [[Genocide]], (II) [[Crimes against humanity]], (III) [[War crime]]s, and (IV) [[Crime of aggression]].

The Rome Statute is the result of multiple attempts for the creation of a supranational and international tribunal. At the end of the 19th century, the international community took the first steps towards the institution of permanent courts with supranational jurisdiction. With the [[Hague Conferences|Hague International Peace Conferences]], representatives of the most powerful nations made an attempt to harmonize [[laws of war]] and to limit the use of technologically advanced weapons. After [[World War I]] and even more after the heinous crimes committed during [[World War II]], it became a priority to prosecute individuals responsible for egregious crimes so serious that they needed to be exemplified by being referred to as "crimes against humanity". In order to re-affirm basic principles of democratic civilisation, the alleged criminals were not executed in public squares or sent to torture camps, but instead treated as criminals: with a regular trial, the right to [[Defense (legal)|defense]] and the [[presumption of innocence]]. The [[Nuremberg trials]] marked a crucial moment in [[legal history]], and after that, some treaties that led to the drafting of the Rome Statute were signed.

UN General Assembly Resolution n. 260 9 December 1948, the [[Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide]], was the first step towards the establishment of an international permanent criminal tribunal with jurisdiction on crimes yet to be defined in international treaties. In the resolution there was a hope for an effort from the Legal UN commission in that direction. The General Assembly, after the considerations expressed from the commission, established a committee to draft a statute and study the related legal issues. In 1951 a first draft was presented; a second draft followed in 1955 but there were a number of delays, officially due to the difficulties in the definition of the [[crime of aggression]], that were only solved with diplomatic assemblies in the years following the statute's coming into force. The geopolitical tensions of the [[Cold War]] also contributed to the delays.

Trinidad and Tobago asked the General Assembly in December 1989 to re-open the talks for the establishment of an international criminal court and in 1994 presented a draft Statute. The General Assembly created an ''ad hoc'' committee for the International Criminal Court and, after hearing the conclusions, a Preparatory Committee that worked for two years (1996–1998) on the draft. Meanwhile, the United Nations created the ''ad hoc'' tribunals for the former Yugoslavia ([[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia|ICTY]]) and for Rwanda ([[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda|ICTR]]) using statutes—and amendments due to issues raised during pre-trial or trial stages of the proceedings—that are quite similar to the Rome Statute.

During its 52nd session the UN General Assembly decided to convene a diplomatic conference for the establishment of the International Criminal Court, held in Rome 15 June–17 July 1998 to define the treaty, entered into force on 1 July 2002. This Rome Conference was attended by representatives from 161 member states, along with observers from various other organizations, intergovernmental organizations and agencies, and non-governmental organizations (including many human rights groups) and was held at the headquarters of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, located about 4&amp;nbsp;km away from the Vatican (one of the states represented).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://legal.un.org/icc/statute/finalfra.htm |title=Final Act of the International Criminal Court |access-date=18 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019222526/http://legal.un.org/icc/statute/finalfra.htm |archive-date=19 October 2013 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://legal.un.org/diplomaticconferences/icc-1998/vol/english/vol_II_e.pdf |title=Rome Conference list of attendees and meeting notes |access-date=18 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019222446/http://legal.un.org/diplomaticconferences/icc-1998/vol/english/vol_II_e.pdf |archive-date=19 October 2013 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jurisdiction, structure and amendment==
{{see also|Review Conference of the Rome Statute|Amendments to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court}}
The Rome Statute outlines the ICC's structure and areas of jurisdiction. The ICC can prosecute individuals (but not states or organizations) for four kinds of crimes: genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and the crime of aggression. These crimes are detailed in Articles 6, 7, 8, and 8 ''bis'' of the Rome Statute, respectively. They must have been committed after 1 July 2002, when the Rome Statute came into effect.

The ICC has jurisdiction over these crimes in three cases: first, if they took place on the territory of a State Party; second, if they were committed by a national of a State Party; or third, if the crimes were referred to the Prosecutor by the UN Security Council. The ICC may begin an investigation before issuing a warrant if the crimes were referred by the UN Security Council or if a State Party requests an investigation. Otherwise, the Prosecutor must seek authorization from a Pre-Trial Chamber of three judges to begin an investigation ''proprio motu'' (on its own initiative). The only type of immunity the ICC recognizes is that it cannot prosecute those under 18 when the crime was committed. In particular, no officials – not even a head of state – are immune from prosecution.

The Rome Statute established three bodies: the ICC itself, the Assembly of States Parties (ASP), and the Trust Fund for Victims. The ASP has two subsidiary bodies. These are the Permanent Secretariat, established in 2003, and an elected Bureau which includes a president and vice-president.  The ICC itself has four organs: the Presidency (with mostly administrative responsibilities); the Divisions (the Pre-Trial, Trial, and Appeals judges); the Office of the Prosecutor; and the Registry (whose role is to support the other three organs). The functions of these organs are detailed in Part 4 of the Rome Statute.

Any amendment to the Rome Statute requires the support of a two-thirds majority of the states parties, and an amendment (except those amending the list of crimes) will not enter into force until it has been ratified by seven-eighths of the states parties. A state party which has not ratified such an amendment may withdraw with immediate effect.&lt;ref name=a121&gt;Article 121 of the [http://legal.un.org/icc/statute/99_corr/cstatute.htm Rome Statute] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019222421/http://legal.un.org/icc/statute/99_corr/cstatute.htm |date=19 October 2013 }}. Retrieved on 18 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Any amendment to the list of crimes within the jurisdiction of the court will only apply to those states parties that have ratified it. It does not need a seven-eighths majority of ratifications.&lt;ref name=a121/&gt;

The '''War Crimes Act of 1996''' is a law that defines a [[war crime]] to include a "[[Geneva Conventions#Grave breaches|grave breach]] of the [[Geneva Conventions]]", specifically noting that "grave breach" should have the meaning defined in any convention (related to the [[laws of war]]) to which the [[United States]] is a party. The definition of "grave breach" in some of the Geneva Conventions have text that extend additional protections, but all the Conventions share the following text in common: "...&amp;nbsp;committed against persons or property protected by the Convention: willful killing, [[torture]] or [[Cruel and unusual punishment|inhuman treatment]], including biological experiments, willfully causing great suffering or serious injury to body or health."

The law applies if either the victim or the perpetrator is a national of the United States or a member of the [[U.S. Armed Forces]]. The penalty may be [[life imprisonment]] or [[death penalty|death]]. The death penalty is only invoked if the conduct resulted in the death of one or more victims.

The act was passed with overwhelming majorities by the [[United States Congress]] and signed into law by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Bill Clinton]].

==Legislative history==
The law criminalized breaches of the Geneva Conventions so that the United States could prosecute war criminals, specifically [[North Vietnam]]ese soldiers who tortured U.S. military personnel during the [[Vietnam War]]. The [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] "fully support[ed] the purposes of the bill,"&lt;ref name="wp060728"&gt;{{cite news | first = R. Jeffrey | last = Smith | authorlink = R. Jeffrey Smith | title = Detainee Abuse Charges Feared | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/27/AR2006072701908_pf.html | work = [[Washington Post]] | page = A1 | date =  2006-07-28 | accessdate = 2006-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; recommending that it be expanded to include a longer list of war crimes. Because the United States generally followed the Conventions, the military recommended making breaches by U.S. military personnel war crimes as well "because doing so set a high standard for others to follow."&lt;ref name="wp060728"/&gt; The bill passed by [[unanimous consent]] in the Senate and by a [[voice vote]] in the House,&lt;ref name="wp060728"/&gt; showing that it was entirely uncontroversial at the time.

Ten years later, the [[United States Supreme Court]] ruled in ''[[Hamdan v. Rumsfeld]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|548|05-184|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; that [[Geneva Conventions#Common Article 3|Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions]] applied to the [[War on Terrorism]], with the unstated implication that any [[enhanced interrogation|interrogation technique]] that violated Common Article 3 constituted war crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.commondreams.org/views06/0630-27.htm | title = Did Bush Commit War Crimes? | accessdate = 2006-10-04 | last = Brooks | first = Rosa | authorlink = Rosa Brooks | date =  2006-06-30 | work = [[Los Angeles Times]] | quote = In other words, with the Hamdan decision, U.S. officials found to be responsible for subjecting war on terror detainees to torture, cruel treatment or other 'outrages upon personal dignity' could face prison or even the death penalty.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The possibility that American officials and military personnel could be prosecuted for war crimes for committing the "outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/91.htm | title = Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War | accessdate = 2006-10-04 | author = Diplomatic Conference for the Establishment of International Conventions for the Protection of Victims of War | date =  1949-08-12 | publisher = [[United Nations]] Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights | page = I, a. 3, 1(c) |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061001201518/http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/91.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; prohibited by the Conventions led to a series of proposals to make such actions legal in certain circumstances, which resulted in the [[Military Commissions Act of 2006]].

==Potential application==
[[White House]] officials were concerned that they and other U.S. officials could be prosecuted under the War Crimes Act for the U.S. treatment of detainees after the [[September 11 attacks]] for violations of the Geneva Conventions. In a January 2002 memorandum to the president, then-[[White House Counsel]] [[Alberto Gonzales]] authored a controversial memo that explored whether Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions applied to [[Al Qaeda]] and [[Taliban]] [[combatants]] captured during the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|war in Afghanistan]] and held in detention facilities around the world, including [[Camp X-Ray]] in [[Guantánamo Bay, Cuba|Guantanamo Bay]], [[Cuba]]. The memo made several arguments both for and against providing Common Article 3's protections to Al Qaeda and Taliban combatants. He concluded that Common Article 3 was outdated and ill-suited for dealing with captured Al Qaeda and Taliban combatants. He described as "quaint" the provisions that require providing captured Al Qaeda and Taliban combatants "commissary privileges, scrip, athletic uniforms, and scientific instruments". He also argued that existing military regulations and instructions from the President were more than adequate to ensure that the principles of the Geneva Conventions would be applied. He also argued that undefined language in the Geneva Conventions, such as "outrages upon personal dignity" and "inhuman treatment", could make officials and military leaders subject to the War Crimes Act of 1996 if mistreatment was discovered.&lt;ref&gt;Gonzales, Alberto. [https://web.archive.org/web/20040519003846/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4999148/site/newsweek/ Decision Re Application of the Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War to the Conflict with Al Qaeda and the Taliban], Memorandum for the President, January 25, 2002. (PDF file provided by MSNBC/Newsweek)&lt;/ref&gt;

The adoption of the [[Military Commissions Act of 2006]] marked grave abuses of Common Article 3 to only include torture, cruel or inhumane treatment, [[murder]], [[mutilation]] or [[maiming]], intentionally causing serious bodily harm, [[rape]], [[sexual assault]] or abuse, and the [[hostage|taking of hostages]], thereby limiting the scope of the original law.

The '''War Crimes Act 1991''' is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. It confers jurisdiction on courts in the [[United Kingdom]] to try people for [[war crimes]] committed in [[Nazi Germany]] or German-occupied territory during the [[World War II|Second World War]] by people who were not British citizens at the time, but have since become British citizens or residents. The legislation was enacted, as there then were no provisions to allow the extradition of [[British resident]]s, or [[naturalised citizen]]s to face trial for war crimes in third countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/274989.stm Prosecution prepares war crimes trial] ''[[BBC News]], [[news.bbc.co.uk]]'', 8 February 1999 (accessed 10 January 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Other countries, such as the [[United States]] have used [[Civil law (common law)|civil]], rather than [[criminal law|criminal]] proceedings, to resolve this issue by revoking citizenship of suspects, facilitating their deportation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/1525553.stm Unhappy record on Nazi suspects] ''[[BBC News]], [[news.bbc.co.uk]]'', 8 February 1999 (accessed 10 January 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act was rejected by the [[House of Lords]], and so it was passed with the authority of only the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]], under the provisions of the [[Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949]]. The Parliament Acts are rarely invoked: the War Crimes Act was only the fourth statute since 1911 enacted under their provisions, and the first since the Parliament Act 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard|url=https://www.theyworkforyou.com/wrans/?id=2010-04-08a.462.0|house=House of Lords|date=8 April 2010|column=462-463|title=Parliament Acts: House of Lords written question – answered on 8th April 2010.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The War Crimes Act remains the only time that the Parliament Acts were invoked by a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government.

To date only one person, [[Anthony Sawoniuk]], has been convicted under the Act. In 1999, he was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] for [[murder]] during his involvement with the collaborationist [[Belarusian Auxiliary Police]]. He died in jail in 2005.

The first person to be charged, however, was fellow Belarusian officer, Symon Serafinowicz Sr. His trial commenced in 1997 for the murder of three unnamed Jews committed as during his role as Police chief in [[Mir, Belarus|Mir]]. At this stage, he was in the advanced stages of dementia and was declared medically unfit. He died later that year.

      <text bytes="1368" xml:space="preserve">The '''Coalition for International Justice''' (CIJ) was an international, [[non-profit]] organization based in both [[Washington D.C.]] and [[The Hague]] that supported the international [[war crimes]] [[tribunals]] for [[Rwanda]] and the former [[Yugoslavia]], and criminal and transitional justice initiatives for [[East Timor]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Cambodia]], and [[Sudan]].  CIJ initiated and conducted advocacy and public education campaigns, targeting decision-makers in [[Washington DC|Washington]] and other capitals, media, and the public.

In the field, CIJ provided practical assistance on legal, technical, and outreach matters to the tribunals and other justice initiatives.  From 2000-2003, CIJ conducted a substantial rule of law project in East Timor.  Most recently, in July 2004, CIJ assembled an international team of professionals who conducted over 1,200 interviews in Chad with refugees who had fled the [[Darfur conflict|conflict in Darfur]], Sudan.

On March 31, 2006, the Coalition for Justice closed operations. In a letter from its board of directors, they noted that CIJ "was not intended to become a permanent institution."[http://www.cij.org/CIJ_Farewell_Letter.pdf]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}

The '''''Report of the International Commission to Inquire into the Causes and Conduct of the Balkan Wars''''' is a document published in the [[Washington D.C.]] in 1914 by the [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]].

The International Commission consisted of university professors and other prominent individuals from [[French Third Republic|France]], [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]], [[United States]], [[German Empire|Germany]], [[Austro-Hungary|Austria]] and [[Russian Empire|Russia]]. Among the members of the Commission there were three [[Nobel Prize]] winners.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IzI0uOZ2j6gC&amp;pg=PA66&amp;dq=serbia+albania+1912&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=8#v=onepage&amp;q=serbia%20albania%201912&amp;f=false Miranda Vickers, The Albanians: a modern history (p. 72)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commission went to the [[Balkans]] at the beginning of August 1913 and remained until the end of September. After returning to [[Paris]] all the material was processed and released in the form of a detailed [[report]]. The report speaks of the numerous violations of international conventions and [[war crimes]] committed during the [[Balkan Wars]]. The information collected was published by the Endowment in the early summer of 1914, but was soon overshadowed by the beginning of the [[First World War]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carnegieendowment.org/publications/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=199 Other Balkan Wars: A 1913 Carnegie Endowment Inquiry in Retrospect]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nuremberg Trials retouched.jpg|thumb|right|Defendants in the dock at the [[Nuremberg trials]]]]
'''Superior orders''', often known as the '''Nuremberg defense''', '''just following orders''', or by the [[German language|German]] phrase '''Befehl ist Befehl''' ("an order is an order"), is a [[plea]] in a court of law that a person—whether a member of the [[military]], [[law enforcement]], a [[firefighting]] force, or the [[civilian]] population—not be held guilty for actions ordered by a [[Officer (armed forces)|superior officer]] or an [[official]].&lt;ref&gt;''See'' L.C. Green, ''Superior Orders in National and International Law'', (A. W. Sijthoff International Publishing Co., Netherlands, 1976)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark J. Osiel, ''Obeying Orders: Atrocity, Military Discipline, and the Law of War'', (Transactions Publishers, New Brunswick, N.J., 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
The superior orders plea is often regarded as the complement to [[command responsibility]].&lt;ref&gt;''See'' James B. Insco, ''Defense of Superior Orders Before Military Commissions'', Duke Journal of Comparative and International Law, 13 DUKEJCIL 389 (Spring, 2003). Asserting in the author's view that a ''respondeat superior'' approach to superior orders is an "underinclusive extreme".&lt;/ref&gt; 

One of the most noted uses of this plea, or [[defense (legal)|defense]], was by the accused in the 1945–1946 [[Nuremberg trials]], such that it is also called the "Nuremberg defense". The Nuremberg trials were a series of [[Military justice|military tribunals]], held by the main victorious [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] after [[World War II]], most notable for the prosecution of prominent members of the political, military, and economic leadership of the defeated [[Nazi Germany]]. These trials, under the [[London Charter of the International Military Tribunal]] that set them up, established that the defense of superior orders was no longer enough to escape punishment, but merely enough to lessen punishment.&lt;ref&gt;H. T. King Jr., ''The Legacy of Nuremberg'', Case Western Journal of International Law, Vol. 34. (Fall 2002) at p. 335.e&lt;/ref&gt; 

Historically, the plea of superior orders has been used both before and after the Nuremberg Trials, with a [[#Historical overview summary table|notable lack of consistency in various rulings]]. 

Apart from the specific plea of superior orders, discussions about how the general concept of superior orders ought to be used, or ought not to be used, have taken place in various arguments, rulings and statutes that have not necessarily been part of "after the fact" [[war crimes trials]], strictly speaking. Nevertheless, these discussions and related events help to explain the evolution of the specific plea of superior orders and the history of its usage.

==The trial of Peter von Hagenbach==

[[Image:Deutsche Geschichte5-310.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Hagenbach on trial, from [[Bern]]er Chronik des Diebold Schilling dem Älteren]]

In 1474, in the trial of [[Peter von Hagenbach]] by an ad hoc tribunal of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], the first known "international" recognition of commanders' obligations to act lawfully occurred.&lt;ref name="Greppi"&gt;[http://www.icrc.ch/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/57JQ2X The evolution of individual criminal responsibility under international law] By Edoardo Greppi, Associate Professor of International Law at the [[University of Turin]], [[Italy]], [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] No. 835, p. 531–553, October 30, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grant"&gt;[http://www.law.harvard.edu/alumni/bulletin/2006/spring/gallery.php Exhibit highlights the first international war crimes tribunal] by Linda Grant, Harvard Law Bulletin.&lt;/ref&gt; Hagenbach offered the defense that he was just following orders, but this defense was rejected and he was convicted of [[war crimes]] and beheaded.&lt;ref name="Schabas"&gt;[http://assets.cambridge.org/97805218/81258/excerpt/9780521881258_excerpt.pdf An Introduction to the International Criminal Court] William A.

Specifically, Hagenbach was put on trial for atrocities committed under his command but not by him directly, during the occupation of [[Breisach]]. This was the earliest modern European example of the doctrine of [[command responsibility]].&lt;ref name="Schabas"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mens_Rea"&gt;[http://www.globalpolicy.org/intljustice/general/2005/command.htm Command Responsibility] The Mens Rea Requirement, By Eugenia Levine, [[Global Policy Forum]], February 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Since he was convicted for crimes "he as a knight was deemed to have a duty to prevent", Hagenbach defended himself by arguing that he was only following orders&lt;ref name="Greppi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Murray"&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/reportsfromabroad/murray/20020718.html Judge and master] By Don Murray, [[CBC News]], July 18, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[Duke of Burgundy]], [[Charles the Bold]], to whom the Holy Roman Empire had given Breisach.&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.gsu.edu/Miller_Lecture/2006/MillerLecture-S06-BassiouniDraft.pdf The Perennial Conflict Between International Criminal Justice and Realpolitik] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910183610/http://law.gsu.edu/Miller_Lecture/2006/MillerLecture-S06-BassiouniDraft.pdf |date=2008-09-10 }} February 10, 2006 Draft by M.

==History from 1900 to 1947==

===Court-martial of Breaker Morant===

{{see also|Court-martial of Breaker Morant}}

During the [[Second Boer War]], three Australian officers ([[Breaker Morant|Morant]], [[Peter Handcock|Handcock]] and [[George Witton|Witton]]) were charged and tried for a number of murders, including those of prisoners who had surrendered. A significant part of the defense was that they were acting under orders issued by [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]] to "take no prisoners". However, these orders were verbal, were denied by Kitchener and his staff, and could not be validated in court, resulting in a guilty verdict against all three men.

===German military trials after World War I===

On June 4, 1921, the legal doctrine of superior orders was used during the [[Leipzig War Crimes Trials|German Military Trials]] that took place after [[World War I]]: One of the most famous of these trials was the matter of Lieutenant Karl Neumann, who was a [[U-boat]] captain responsible for the sinking of the hospital ship the ''[[HMHS Dover Castle|Dover Castle]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9C04EEDA1739E133A25756C0A9609C946095D6CF |title=Free Man Who Sank a Hospital Ship; Leipsic Judges Acquit Neumann on the Ground That He Acted Under Orders. He Admitted Torpedoing. Prosecutor Demanded Acquittal, Calling Dover Castle Culpable in Carrying Wounded Soldiers. |author=New York Times |date=June 5, 1921 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=10 April 2010|author-link=New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though he frankly admitted to having sunk the ship, he stated that he had done so on the basis of orders supplied to him by the [[German Imperial Admiralty Staff|German Admiralty]] and so he could not be held liable for his actions. The [[Reichsgericht]], then Germany's supreme court, acquitted him, accepting the defense of superior orders as a grounds to escape criminal liability.&lt;ref&gt;Anon., "German War Trials: Judgement in Case of Commander Karl Neumann", ''The American Journal of International Law'', Vol. 16, No. 4. (Oct., 1922) at pp. 704–708.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, that very court had this to say in the matter of superior orders: "... that all civilized nations recognize the principle that a subordinate is covered by the orders of his superiors."&lt;ref&gt;G. A. Finch, "Superior Orders and War Crimes", ''The American Journal of International Law'', Vol. 15, No. 3. (Jul., 1921) at pp. 440–445.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many accused of war crimes were acquitted on a similar defense, creating immense dissatisfaction among the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. This is thought to be one of the main causes for the specific removal of this defense in the August 8, 1945 [[London Charter of the International Military Tribunal]]. The removal has been attributed to the actions of [[Robert H. Jackson]], a Justice of the [[United States Supreme Court]], who was appointed Chief Prosecutor at the [[Nuremberg trials]].

On the other hand, when the defendants could not reasonably claim that they did not know their orders were clearly illegal, the defense was ineffective. For instance, Lieutenants Dithmar and Boldt were ordered to fire on lifeboats, obeyed the order, and were found guilty in the same [[Leipzig War Crimes Trials|German Military Trials]]&lt;ref&gt;"German War Trials: Judgment in Case of Lieutenants Dithmar and Boldt." ''The American Journal of International Law'', vol. 16, no. 4, 1922, at pp. 708–724.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dostler case===
[[File:Anton Dostler 1945 Colourized.jpg|thumb|right|Colorized image of Dostler tied to a stake before the execution]]
On October 8, 1945, [[Anton Dostler]] was the first [[General (Germany)|German general]] to be tried for war crimes by a US [[military tribunal]] at the [[Royal Palace of Caserta|Royal Palace]] in [[Caserta]]. He was accused of ordering the execution of 15 captured US soldiers of [[Operations Ginny I and II|Operation Ginny II]] in Italy in March 1944. He admitted to ordering the execution but said that he could not be held responsible because he was following orders from his superiors. The execution of the [[prisoners of war]] in Italy, ordered by Dostler, was an implementation of [[Adolf Hitler]]'s [[Commando Order]] of 1942, which required the immediate execution of all [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[commandos]], whether they were in proper uniforms or not, without trial if they were apprehended by German forces. The tribunal rejected the defense of Superior Orders and found Dostler guilty of war crimes. He was sentenced to death and [[execution by firing squad|executed by a firing squad]] on December 1, 1945, in [[Aversa]].

The Dostler case became a precedent for the principle that was used in the Nuremberg Trials of German generals, officials, and Nazi leaders beginning in November 1945: using superior orders as a defense does not relieve officers from responsibility of carrying out illegal orders and their liability to be punished in court. The principle was codified in [[Nuremberg Principles#Principle IV|Principle IV]] of the [[Nuremberg Principles]], and similar principles were found in sections of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].

===Nuremberg Trials after World War II===
[[File:Defendants in the dock at nuremberg trials.jpg|thumb|Rare color photo of the trial at Nuremberg, depicting the defendants, guarded by American Military Police]]
{{See also|Nuremberg trials}}

In 1945 and 1946, during the [[Nuremberg trials]] the issue of superior orders again arose. Before the end of [[World War II]], the Allies suspected such a defense might be employed and issued the [[London Charter of the International Military Tribunal]] (IMT), which explicitly stated that following an unlawful order is not a valid defense against charges of [[war crime]]s.

Thus, under [[Nuremberg Principles#Principle IV|Nuremberg Principle IV]], "defense of superior orders" is not a defense for war crimes, although it might be a mitigating factor that could influence a sentencing authority to lessen the penalty. Nuremberg Principle IV states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The fact that a person acted pursuant to order of his Government or of a superior does not relieve him from responsibility under international law, provided a moral choice was in fact possible to him.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During the Nuremberg Trials, [[Wilhelm Keitel]], [[Alfred Jodl]], and other defendants unsuccessfully used the defense. They contended that while they knew [[Adolf Hitler]]'s orders were unlawful, or at least had reason to believe they were unlawful, their place was not to question, but to obey. They claimed they were compelled to do so by the ''[[Führerprinzip]]'' (leader principle) that governed the Nazi regime, as well as their own [[Hitler oath|oath of allegiance to Hitler]]. In most cases, the tribunal found that the defendants' offenses were so egregious that obedience to superior orders could not be considered a mitigating factor.

(Before the trials, there was little consensus among the Allies as to what was to be done with the [[Nazi]] war prisoners. [[Winston Churchill]] was inclined to have the leaders 'executed as outlaws'.&lt;ref name="Timesarticle784041"&gt;{{cite news|title=Churchill: execute Hitler without trial|work=[[The Times]]|publisher=[[Times Newspapers Limited]]|date=2006-01-01|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article784041.ece|accessdate=2008-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviets desired trials but wished there to be a presumption of guilt, as opposed to the procedural presumption of innocence that accompanies most [[Western civilization|Western]] criminal trials.&lt;ref&gt;K.C. Moghalu, Global Justice: The Politics of War Crime Trials, (Greenwood Publishers, 2006), sourced from Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt;)

The German military law since 1872 said &lt;ref&gt;''Militär-Strafgesetzbuch für das Deutsche Reich, § 47''. The difference to the present regulation, as found in the ''Wehrstrafgesetz'' § 5, is only marginal, at least as far as the letter of the law is concerned.&lt;/ref&gt; that while the superior is ("solely") responsible for his order, the subordinate ''is'' to be punished for his participation in it if he either transgressed the order on his own account, or if he knew the order to be criminal.&lt;ref&gt;''wenn ihm bekannt gewesen, daß der Befehl des Vorgesetzten eine Handlung betraf, welche ein bürgerliches oder militärisches Verbrechen oder Vergehen bezweckte'', i.e., "... if it was known to him that the superior's order concerned an action that aimed at a civil or military felony or misdemeanor". According to general legal interpretation, "if he knew" means "unless he didn't know ''and'' had a valid excuse for not knowing".&lt;/ref&gt; For many of their offenses (e.g., killing a non-combatant without trial) the Nazis did not bother to (or were too reluctant to) legalize them by a formal law, so, the prosecutors at Nuremberg could have argued that the defendants broke German law to begin with. However, this line of argumentation was infrequently used in the trials.

==="Nuremberg defense"===

The trials gained so much attention that the "superior orders defense" has subsequently become interchangeable with the label "Nuremberg defense", a [[legal defense]] that essentially states that defendants were "only following orders" ("Befehl ist Befehl", literally "an order is an order") and so are not responsible for their crimes.

However, US General [[Telford Taylor]], who had served as Chief Counsel for the United States during the Nuremberg trials, employed the term "Nuremberg defense" in a different sense. He applied it not to the defense offered by the Nuremberg defendants but to a justification put forward by those who refused to take part in military action (specifically America's involvement in the Vietnam War) that they believed to be criminal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Telford|title=Nuremberg and Vietnam: An American Tragedy|year=1970|publisher=The New York Times Group|location=New York|pages=15|quote=The claim that American intervention in Vietnam is itself an aggressive war and therefore criminal - the so-called 'Nuremberg defense' - has been put forward by draft card burners, draftees facing induction and soldiers about to be shipped to Vietnam.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History from 1947 to 2000==
[[File:Adolf Eichmann at Trial1961.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Eichmann on trial in 1961]]
The defense of superior orders again arose in the 1961 trial of Nazi war criminal [[Adolf Eichmann]] in [[Israel]], as well as the trial of [[Alfredo Astiz]] of [[Argentina]], the latter responsible for a large number of disappearances and kidnappings that took place during that country's [[National Reorganization Process|last civil-military dictatorship]] (1976-1983), which forced a [[State-sponsored terrorism]] upon the population,&lt;ref name="cineaste.com"&gt;[http://www.cineaste.com/articles/emthe-secret-in-their-eyesem-historical-memory-production-models-and-the-foreign-film-oscar The Secret in Their Eyes: Historical Memory, Production Models, and the Foreign Film Oscar (WEB EXCLUSIVE)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120127110647/http://www.cineaste.com/articles/emthe-secret-in-their-eyesem-historical-memory-production-models-and-the-foreign-film-oscar |date=2012-01-27 }} Matt Losada, ''[[Cineaste Magazine]]'', 2010&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in what (to several sources) amounted to a [[genocide]].&lt;ref&gt;CONADEP, Nunca Más Report, Chapter II, Section One:''Advertencia'', [http://www.desaparecidos.org/arg/conadep/nuncamas/] {{in lang|es}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hmh.org/la_Genocide_Argentina.shtml Atrocities in Argentina (1976–1983)] [[Holocaust Museum Houston]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s and 1960s the use of ''[[Befehlsnotstand]]'' ({{lang-en|Compulsion to obey orders}}), a concept in which a certain action is ordered which violates law but where the refusal to carry out such an order would lead to drastic consequences for the person refusing to carry out the order, as a defence in war crimes trials in Germany was quite successful as it protected the accused from punishment. With the formation of the [[Central Office of the State Justice Administrations for the Investigation of National Socialist Crimes]] this changed as a historical research by the organisation revealed that refusing an unlawful order did not result in punishment.&lt;ref name="Welt 2015" &gt;{{cite news |last=Kellerhoff |first=Sven Felix |author-link=Sven Felix Kellerhoff |date=15 July 2015|title=Hatten SS-Mitglieder damals wirklich "keine Wahl"?|trans-title=Did SS members really have no choice?|url=https://www.welt.de/geschichte/zweiter-weltkrieg/article144067359/Hatten-SS-Mitglieder-damals-wirklich-keine-Wahl.html|language=German |work=[[Die Welt]] |location= |access-date=17 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israeli law since 1956===
In 1957, the Israeli legal system established the concept of a 'blatantly illegal order' to explain when a military order (or in general, a security-related order) should be followed, and when an order ''must not'' be followed. The concept is explained in 1957 by the infamous [[Kafr Qasim massacre]] ruling.

The Kafr Qasim trial considered for the first time the issue of when Israeli security personnel are required to disobey illegal orders. The judges decided that soldiers do not have the obligation to examine each and every order in detail as to its legality, nor were they entitled to disobey orders merely on a subjective feeling that they might be illegal. On the other hand, some orders were manifestly illegal, and these must be disobeyed. Judge [[Benjamin Halevy]]'s words, still much-quoted today, were that "The distinguishing mark of a manifestly illegal order is that above such an order should fly, like a black flag, a warning saying: 'Prohibited!'"&lt;ref&gt;M. R. Lippman, Humanitarian Law: The Development and Scope of the Superior Orders Defense, Penn State International Law Review, Fall 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leora Y. Bilsky, Transformative Justice : Israeli Identity on Trial (Law, Meaning, and Violence), University of Michigan Press, 2004, {{ISBN|0-472-03037-X}}, pp169–197, 310-324.&lt;/ref&gt;

Captain (res.) Itai Haviv, a signatory of the 'courage to refuse' letter of 2002 tells of his unhappiness about his service for the [[Israeli Defense Forces]] (IDF) and says "For 35 years a black flag was proudly hanging over our heads, but we have refused to see it". A translation note explains the "Black Flag" principle but adds "In the 45 years that passed since [the ruling], not even a single soldier was protected by a military court for refusing to obey a command because it was a 'black flag' command."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seruv.org.il/Signers/ItaiHavivEng.asp]&lt;/ref&gt;

===1968 My Lai Massacre===
Following the [[My Lai Massacre]] in 1968, the defense was employed during the court martial of [[William Calley]]. Some have argued that the outcome of the My Lai Massacre courts martial was a reversal of the laws of war that were set forth in the [[Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunal|Nuremberg]] and [[Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Marshall|first=Burke|author2=Goldstein, Joseph |title=Learning From My Lai: A Proposal on War Crimes|work=The New York Times|date=2 April 1976|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Secretary of the Army]] [[Howard Callaway]] was quoted in the ''New York Times'' as stating that Calley's sentence was reduced because Calley believed that what he did was a part of his orders.  Calley used the exact phrase "just following orders" when another American soldier, [[Hugh Thompson Jr.|Hugh Thompson]], confronted him about the ongoing massacre.

In ''[[United States v. Keenan]]'', the accused was found guilty of murder after he obeyed an order to shoot and kill an elderly [[Vietnam]]ese citizen. The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces|Court of Military Appeals]] held that "the justification for acts done pursuant to orders does not exist if the order was of such a nature that a man of ordinary sense and understanding would know it to be illegal". The soldier who gave the order, Corporal Luczko, was acquitted by reason of insanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://usmilitary.about.com/cs/militarylaw1/a/obeyingorders.htm |title= Military Orders To Obey or Not to Obey?|author=Rod Powers |work= About.com: US Military|publisher= |accessdate=16 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The 1998 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court===
{{Further|States Parties to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court}}
The provision containing the superior orders defense can be found as a defense to international crimes in the [[Rome Statute]] of the [[International Criminal Court]]. (The Rome Statute was agreed upon in 1998 as the foundational document of the International Criminal Court, established to try those individuals accused of serious international crimes.) Article 33, titled "Superior orders and prescription of law",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://legal.un.org/icc/statute/romefra.htm|title=Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court; Part 3: General Principles of Criminal Law; Article 33: Superior orders and prescription of law|author= Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|date=10 November 1998 and 12 July 1999 |publisher=Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court |accessdate=21 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|1.	The fact that a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court has been committed by a person pursuant to an order of a Government or of a superior, whether military or civilian, shall not relieve that person of criminal responsibility unless:

*(a) The person was under a legal obligation to obey orders of the Government or the superior in question;
*(b) The person did not know that the order was unlawful; and
*(c) The order was not manifestly unlawful.

2. For the purposes of this article, orders to commit genocide or crimes against humanity are manifestly unlawful.}}

There are two interpretations{{who|date=November 2010}} of this Article:

*This formulation, especially (1)(a), whilst effectively prohibiting the use of the Nuremberg defense in relation to charges of genocide and crimes against humanity, does however, appear to allow the Nuremberg defense to be used as a protection against charges of war crimes, provided the relevant criteria are met.
*Nevertheless, this interpretation of ICC Article 33 is open to debate: For example, Article 33 (1)(c) protects the defendant only if "the order was not manifestly unlawful". The "order" could be considered "unlawful" if we consider [[Nuremberg Principles#Principle IV|Nuremberg Principle IV]] to be the applicable "law" in this case. If so, then the defendant is not protected. Discussion as to whether or not Nuremberg Principle IV is the applicable law in this case is found in [[Nuremberg Principles#The Principles.27 power or lack of power|a discussion of the Nuremberg Principles' power or lack of power]].

===Legal proceedings of Jeremy Hinzman in Canada===

{{See also|Jeremy Hinzman|Anne L. Mactavish|Canada and Iraq War resisters}}
[[Nuremberg Principles#Principle IV|Nuremberg Principle IV]], and its reference to an individual's responsibility, was at issue in [[Canada]] in the case of ''Hinzman v. Canada.'' [[Jeremy Hinzman]] was a [[U.S. Army]] [[deserter]] who claimed [[refugee]] status in Canada as a [[conscientious objector]], one of [[List of Iraq War Resisters#Objectors who have fled to Canada|many Iraq War resisters]]. Hinzman's lawyer, (at that time [[Jeffry House]]), had previously raised the issue of the [[legality of the Iraq War]] as having a bearing on their case. The [[Federal Court (Canada)|Federal Court]] ruling was released on March 31, 2006, and denied the refugee status claim.&lt;ref name="Mernagh, M"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nowtoronto.com/news/story.cfm?content=153504&amp;archive=25,38,2006|title=AWOL GIs Dealt Legal Blow|date=2006-05-18|author=Mernagh, M.|publisher=Toronto's Now Magazine|access-date=2008-06-02|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605061945/http://www.nowtoronto.com/news/story.cfm?content=153504&amp;archive=25%2C38%2C2006|archive-date=2011-06-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://reports.fja.gc.ca/eng/2006/2006fc420/2006fc420.html|title=Hinzman v.

Mactavish]] addressed the issue of personal responsibility:
&lt;blockquote&gt;An individual must be involved at the policy-making level to be culpable for a crime against peace ... the ordinary foot soldier is not expected to make his or her own personal assessment as to the legality of a conflict.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Legal proceedings of Ehren Watada in the United States===

In June 2006, during the [[Iraq War]], [[Ehren Watada]] refused to go to Iraq on account of his belief that the Iraq war was a [[crime against peace]] (waging a [[war of aggression]] for territorial aggrandizement), which he believed could make him liable for prosecution under the [[command responsibility doctrine]]. In this case, the judge ruled that soldiers, in general, are not responsible for determining whether the order to go to war itself is a lawful order – but are only responsible for those orders resulting in a specific application of military force, such as an order to shoot civilians, or to treat POWs inconsistently with the Geneva Conventions. This is consistent with the Nuremberg defense, as only the civilian and military principals of the Axis were charged with [[crimes against peace]], while subordinate military officials were not so charged.&lt;ref name=SeattlePI060620&gt;[http://www.seattlepi.com/local/274585_watada20.html Soldier's Iraq war stance backed: Watada has right to refuse to go, retired officer says], ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]'', June 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; It is often the case in modern warfare that while subordinate military officials are not held liable for their actions, neither are their superiors, as was the case with Calley's immediate superior Captain Ernest Medina.

Based on this principle, [[international law]] developed the concept of individual criminal liability for war crimes, which resulted in the current doctrine of [[command responsibility]].&lt;ref name="Danner-Martinez"&gt;[http://www.law.berkeley.edu/students/curricularprograms/ils/workshop/fall04_Martinez.pdf Guilty Associations: Joint Criminal Enterprise, Command Responsibility, and the Development of International Criminal Law] [https://web.archive.org/web/20060910213027/http://www.law.berkeley.edu/students/curricularprograms/ils/workshop/fall04_Martinez.pdf HTML version] by Allison Marston Danner and Jenny S.

===Arguments===

{{See also|international legal theory|sources of international law|laws of war|Rule of Law in Armed Conflicts Project}}
The superior orders defense is still used with the following rationale in the following scenario: An "order" may come from one's superior at the level of ''national'' law. But according to [[Nuremberg Principles#Principle IV|Nuremberg Principle IV]], such an order is sometimes "unlawful" according to ''international'' law. Such an "unlawful order" presents a legal dilemma from which there is no legal escape: On one hand, a person who ''refuses'' such an unlawful order faces the possibility of legal punishment ''at the national level'' for refusing orders. On the other hand, a person who ''accepts'' such an unlawful order faces the possibility of legal punishment ''at the international level'' (e.g. [[Nuremberg Trials]]) for committing unlawful acts.

[[Nuremberg Principles#Principle II|Nuremberg Principle II]] responds to that dilemma by stating: "The fact that internal law does not impose a penalty for an act which constitutes a crime under [[international law]] does not relieve the person who committed the act from responsibility under international law."&lt;ref&gt;[[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC) [[#References|References]] [http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/INTRO/390?OpenDocument Principles of International Law Recognized in the Charter of the Nüremberg Tribunal and in the Judgment of the Tribunal, 1950: Introduction]&lt;/ref&gt;

The above scenario might present a ''[[law|legal]]'' dilemma, but [[Nuremberg Principles#Principle IV|Nuremberg Principle IV]] speaks of "a ''[[morality|moral]]'' choice" as being just as important as "legal" decisions: It states: "The fact that a person acted pursuant to order of his Government or of a superior does not relieve him from responsibility under international law, provided a ''moral'' choice was in fact possible to him".

In "moral choices" or [[ethical dilemma]]s an [[ethical decision]] is often made by appealing to a "higher ethic" such as [[ethics in religion]] or secular [[ethics]]. One such "higher ethic" found in many religions and in secular ethics, is the ''[[ethic of reciprocity]]'', or ''[[Golden Rule]]''. It states that one has a right to just treatment, and therefore has a reciprocal responsibility to ensure justice for others. ''Higher ethics'', such as those, could be used by an individual to solve the ''legal'' dilemma presented by the superior orders defense.

Although messengers are not usually responsible for the message that their superior sends with them, the [[Babylonian Talmud]] (3rd to 5th century corpus of [[Jewish law]]) states, "There is no messenger in a case of sin."&lt;ref&gt;''Kiddushin'' 42b.  Qtd. in Telushkin, ''The Book of Jewish Values'', 330.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Telushkin]] interprets precept to mean that "if a person is sent to perform an evil act, he cannot defend his behavior by saying he was only acting as another's messenger.  ... [T]he person who carries out the evil act bears responsibility for the evil he or she does."&lt;ref&gt;Telushkin, Joseph.  ''The Book of Jewish Values: A Day-By-Day Guide to Ethical Living''.  New York: Bell Tower, 2000.  p. 330&lt;/ref&gt; This is because God's law (i.e. [[morality]]) supersedes human law.

Another argument against the use of the superior orders defense is that it does not follow the traditional legal definitions and categories established under [[criminal law]]. Under criminal law, a [[principal (criminal law)|principal]] is any actor who is primarily responsible for a criminal offense.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Superior Growers, 982 F.2d at 177–78; United States v. Campa, 679 F.2d 1006, 1013 (lst Cir. 1982).&lt;/ref&gt; Such an actor is distinguished from others who may also be subject to criminal liability as [[accomplice]]s, [[accessory (legal term)|accessories]] or [[conspiracy (crime)|conspirator]]s. (See also the various degrees of liability: [[absolute liability]], [[strict liability]], and [[mens rea]].)

The common argument in this matter, is that every individual under orders should be bound by law to immediately relieve of command a superior officer who gives an obviously unlawful order to their troops. This represents a rational check to be put in place versus organizational command hierarchies.

[[Nuremberg Principles#Principle IV|Nuremberg Principle IV]], the [[international law]] that counters the superior orders defense, is legally supported by the [[jurisprudence]] found in [[Conscientious objector#Universal Declaration of Human Rights|certain articles in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that deal indirectly with conscientious objection]]. It is also supported by [[Conscientious objector#Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status|the principles found in paragraph 171 of the Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status]], which was issued by the Office of the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR). Those principles deal with the conditions under which [[conscientious objector]]s can apply for refugee status in another country if they face persecution in their own country for refusing to participate in an illegal war.

The '''Convention on the Non-Applicability of Statutory Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity''' was adopted and opened for signature, ratification and accession by [[United Nations]] [[UNGA|General Assembly]] resolution 2391 (XXIII) of 26 November 1968.
Pursuant to the provisions of its Article VIII (90 days following the deposit of the tenth ratification), it came into force on 11 November 1970.

The Convention provides that no signatory state may apply [[statutory limitations]] to:
*[[War crimes]] as they are defined in the [[London Charter of the International Military Tribunal|Charter of the]] [[Nürnberg]] [[International Military Tribunal]] of 8 August 1945.
*[[Crimes against humanity]], whether committed in time of war or in time of peace, as defined in the Charter of the Nürnberg International Military Tribunal, eviction by armed attack or occupation, inhuman acts resulting from the policy of [[apartheid]], and the crime of [[genocide]] as defined in the 1948 [[Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide]].

As of January 2015, the Convention has 55 state parties, which includes 54 [[UN member states]] and the [[State of Palestine]].

A '''[[War crime|war crimes]] trial''' is the trial of persons charged with criminal violation of the [[laws and customs of war]] and related principles of [[international law]] committed during [[armed conflict]].

==History==
{{Generalize|section|date=July 2010}}
The trial of [[Peter von Hagenbach]] by an [[ad hoc]] tribunal of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in 1474, was the first “international” war crimes trials and also of [[command responsibility]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icrc.ch/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/57JQ2X The evolution of individual criminal responsibility under international law] By Edoardo Greppi, Associate Professor of International Law at the [[University of Turin]], [[Italy]], [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] No. 835, p. 531-553, October 30, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grant"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.harvard.edu/alumni/bulletin/2006/spring/gallery.php|title=Alumni - Harvard Law School|first=Harvard Law|last=School|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hagenbach was put on trial for atrocities committed during the occupation of [[Breisach]], found guilty, and beheaded.&lt;ref name="Schabas"&gt;[http://assets.cambridge.org/97805218/81258/excerpt/9780521881258_excerpt.pdf An Introduction to the International Criminal Court] William A. Schabas, [[Cambridge University Press]], Third Edition&lt;/ref&gt; Since he was convicted for crimes, "he as a knight was deemed to have a duty to prevent", although Hagenbach defended himself by arguing that he was [[superior orders|only following orders]] from the [[Duke of Burgundy]], [[Charles the Bold]], to whom the Holy Roman Empire had given Breisach.

In 1865, [[Henry Wirz]], a Confederate officer, was held accountable and hanged for appalling conditions at [[Andersonville Prison]] where many Union soldiers died during the [[American Civil War]].

After [[World War I]], a small number of German personnel were tried by a German court in the [[Leipzig War Crimes Trials]] for crimes allegedly committed during that war.

Article 227 of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], the peace treaty between [[Germany]] and the Allied Powers after the [[First World War]], “publicly arraign[ed] [[Kaiser Wilhelm II|William II of Hohenzollern]], formerly German Emperor, for a supreme offence against international morality and the sanctity of treaties.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://net.lib.byu.edu/~rdh7/wwi/versa/versa6.html|title=Peace Treaty of Versailles, Articles 227-230, Penalties|website=net.lib.byu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former Kaiser had escaped to the Netherlands, however, and despite demands for his extradition having been made, the Dutch refused to surrender him,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ww1ieper1917.wordpress.com/2014/01/23/netherlands-refuses-to-extradite-kaiser-wilhelm-to-the-allies-23rd-jan-1920/|title=The Netherlands refuses to extradite Kaiser Wilhelm to the Allies 23rd Jan 1920.|last=ww1ieper1917|date=23 January 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he was not brought to trial. Germany, as a signatory to the treaty, thus was placed on notice as to what might occur in the event of a subsequent war.{{cn|date=October 2018}}
 
After [[World War II]], the phrase referred usually to the trials of [[Germany|German]] and [[Japan]]ese leaders in [[court]]s established by the victorious [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] nations.

The most important of these trials were held in [[Nuremberg]], [[Germany]], under the authority of two legal instruments. One, the [[London Charter]] was signed by representatives of the [[United States]], [[Great Britain]], [[France]], and the [[USSR]] in [[London]] on August 8, 1945; the other, [[Law No. 10]], was promulgated by the [[Allied Control Council]] in [[Berlin]] on December 20, 1945.

The London Charter provided for the establishment of the [[International Military Tribunal]], composed of one [[judge]] and one alternate judge from each of the signatory nations, to try [[war criminals]]. Under the London Charter, the [[crimes]] charged against [[defendants]] fell into three categories: [[crimes against peace]], that is, crimes involving the planning, initiating, and [[War of aggression|waging a war of aggression]]; [[war crimes]], that is, violations of the laws and customs of war as embodied in the [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|Hague Conventions]] and generally recognized by [[military]] forces of civilized nations; and [[crimes against humanity]], such as the [[genocide|extermination]] of [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]], [[ethnic]], and [[religious]] groups and other such atrocities against [[civilians]].

On October 8, 1945, [[Anton Dostler]] was the first [[General (Germany)|German general]] to be tried for war crimes by a U.S. [[military tribunal]] at the [[Royal Palace of Caserta]] in [[Caserta]]. He was accused of ordering the killing of 15 captured U.S. soldiers of [[Operations Ginny I and II|Operation Ginny II]] in Italy in March 1944. He admitted into ordering the execution but said that he cannot be held responsible because he was just [[Superior orders|following orders]] from his superiors. The execution of 15 U.S. [[prisoners of war]] in Italy ordered by Dostler was an implementation of [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s [[Commando Order]] of 1942 which required the immediate execution of all [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[commandos]], whether in proper uniforms or not, without trial if apprehended by German forces. The tribunal rejected the defense of Superior Orders and found Dostler guilty of war crimes. He was sentenced to death and [[Execution by firing squad|executed by a firing squad]] on December 1, 1945, in [[Aversa]].

The Dostler case became precedent for the [[Nuremberg war crime trials|Nuremberg trials]] of German generals, officials, and Nazi leaders beginning in November 1945 that using Superior orders as a defense does not relieve officers from responsibility of carrying out illegal orders and liable to be punished in court. This principle was codified in [[Nuremberg Principles#Principle IV|Principle IV]] of the [[Nuremberg Principles]] and similar principle were found in sections of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].

===Nuremberg trials===
{{main|Nuremberg trials}}
[[Image:nurembergdefendants.jpg|frame|right|The defendants at the Nuremberg War Crime Trial in Nuremberg, Germany]]On October 18, 1945, the chief [[prosecutors]] lodged an [[indictment]] with the [[tribunal]] charging 24 individuals with a variety of crimes and atrocities, including the deliberate instigation of aggressive wars, extermination of racial and religious groups, [[murder]] and [[mistreatment]] of [[prisoners of war]], and the [[murder]], [[mistreatment]], and [[deportation]] of hundreds of thousands of inhabitants of [[countries]] occupied by Germany during the war.

Among the accused were the [[National Socialist German Workers Party|Nationalist Socialist]] leaders [[Hermann Göring]] and [[Rudolf Hess]], the [[diplomat]] [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]], the [[arms industry|munitions maker]] [[Gustav Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach]], [[Field Marshal|Marshal]] [[Wilhelm Keitel]], Grand [[Admiral]] [[Erich Raeder]] and 18 other [[military leaders]] and civilian [[officials]]. Seven organizations that formed part of the basic structure of the [[Nazi]] [[government]] were also charged as [[criminal]]. These organizations included the SS ([[Schutzstaffel]], ''Defense Corps''), the [[Gestapo]] ([[Geheime Staatspolizei]], ''Secret State Police''), and the SA ([[Sturmabteilung]], ''Storm Troops''), as well as the [[General Staff]] and High Command of the German [[armed forces]].

The trial began on November 20, 1945. Much of the [[evidence]] submitted by the [[prosecution]] consisted of original military, [[Diplomacy|diplomatic]], and other government documents that fell into the hands of the [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] after the collapse of the German government.

The judgment of the International Military Tribunal was handed down on September 30-October 1, 1946. Among notable features of the decision was the conclusion, in accordance with the London Agreement, that to plan or instigate an aggressive war is a crime under the principles of international law. The tribunal rejected the contention of the [[Defense (legal)|defense]] that such acts had not previously been defined as crimes under international law and that therefore the condemnation of the [[defendants]] would violate the principle of [[justice]] prohibiting [[ex post facto]] [[punishments]]. As with the Dostler case, it also rejected the contention of a number of the defendants that they were not legally responsible for their acts because they performed the acts under the orders of superior authority, stating that "''the true test . . . is not the existence of the order but whether moral choice (in executing it) was in fact possible''."

With respect to war crimes and crimes against humanity, the tribunal found overwhelming evidence of a systematic rule of [[violence]], brutality, and [[terrorism]] by the German government in the [[Territory (administrative division)|territories]] occupied by its forces. Millions of persons were murdered in [[Nazi concentration camps]], many of which were equipped with [[gas chambers]] for the extermination of [[Jews]], [[Romani people|Gypsies]], and members of other ethnic or religious groups. Under the [[slave-labor]] [[policy]] of the German government, at least 5 million persons had been forcibly deported from their homes to Germany. Many of them died because of [[inhumane]] treatment. The tribunal also found that atrocities had been committed on a large scale and as a matter of official policy.

Of the seven indicted organizations, the tribunal declared criminal the [[Leadership Corps]] of the [[Nazi Party|National Socialist Party]], the SS, the SD ([[Sicherheitsdienst]], ''Security Service''), and the Gestapo.

==Ad hoc tribunals==

In May 1993, during the [[Yugoslav Wars]] following the massive war crimes, and acts of "ethnic cleansing" in the former Yugoslavia by Bosnian-Serb forces, the United Nations established the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia]], to try war criminals of all nationalities. The crimes indicted included grave breaches of the [[Geneva Conventions]], [[war crimes]], [[crimes against humanity]], and [[genocide]]; it was the first tribunal in which [[sexual assault]] was prosecuted as a war crime. The ICTY was the first international war crimes tribunal since the Nuremberg Trials.  Ultimately, nearly 161 individuals were indicted in the ICTY: 68% of Serb ethnicity. Croatian-Serb, Bosnian-Serb, Serbian, and Bosnian-Croat officials were convicted of crimes against humanity, and Bosnian-Serb leaders of genocide.

In 1994, the UN opened the [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] following the April–June genocide in that country of Hutu nationals.

The tribunals, while effective in prosecution of individuals, proved to be a costly venture, and exposed the need for a permanent tribunal, which was eventually known as the [[International Criminal Court]].

      <text bytes="36442" xml:space="preserve">The '''Committee on the Philippines''' was a [[standing committee]] of the [[United States Senate]] from 1899 to 1921.{{ref|stubbs}} The committee was established by Senate resolution on December 15, 1899, to oversee administration of the [[Philippines]], which Spain had ceded to the United States as part of the settlement of the [[Spanish–American War]]. The committee was established by Senate resolution on December 15, 1899, even though the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|peace treaty]] signed in Paris on December 10, 1898, had not yet been ratified.{{ref|nara}}

In 1921, the Committee  was terminated and jurisdiction over legislative matters concerning the Philippines was transferred to the newly created [[United States Senate Committee on Territories and Insular Possessions|Committee on Territories and Insular Possessions]].{{ref|nara}}

{{TOClimit|3}}

==History==
At the time of the creation of the committee, the Philippines were in a state of civil turmoil that greatly concerned the Senate, where a debate raged between those who wished to extend U.S. sovereignty over the Filipinos and the [[anti-imperialist]]s. Like the [[United States Senate Committee on the Pacific Islands and Puerto Rico|Committee on the Pacific Islands and Puerto Rico]], the [[Committee on the Philippines]] focused on primarily on legal and economic matters, such as [[Republic Day (Philippines)|Philippine independence]], administration of the islands by the [[Taft Commission|U.S. Philippine Commission]], and trade issues. Matters relating to the suppression of the Philippine insurrection were often referred to the [[Senate Foreign Relations Committee]].{{ref|nara}}

* [[John F. Shafroth]] (D-CO) 1918-1919
* [[Warren Harding]] (R-OH) 1919-1921

==Lodge Committee==
[[Henry Cabot Lodge]], [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] of [[Massachusetts]], was the committee's first chairman, serving until 1911. During this time, the committee was informally known as the ''Lodge Committee.'' In 1902, under Chairman Lodge, the committee carried out an investigation into  allegations of [[war crime]]s in the [[Philippine–American War]]. The hearings commenced on January 31, 1902{{ref|start}} and adjourned on June 28, 1902.{{ref|finish}} They were closed to the public, except for three press associations.{{ref|feb13}} The final report came to 3,000 pages.{{ref|little}}

A remark to a ''[[Manila News]]'' reporter by newly promoted [[Brigadier General]] [[Jacob H. Smith]] on November 4, 1901, triggered the hearings, which eventually led to Smith's own [[court-martial]] and conviction. Smith said that he intended to set the entire island of [[Samar]] ablaze, and would probably wipe out most of the population.{{ref|manila}}

[[George Frisbie Hoar|Senator George Frisbie Hoar]] had been demanding an investigation after increasing evidence of U.S. military war crimes in the [[Philippine–American War]]. Hoar introduced a resolution to establish a [[select or special committee (United States Congress)|select committee]] to conduct the investigation on January 13, 1902.{{ref|introduced}} However, [[Henry Cabot Lodge|Chairman Lodge]] argued that the hearings would be better conducted by the existing Committee on the Philippines. [[Anti-imperialism|Anti-imperialists]] in the Senate feared a [[whitewash]], because Lodge had been avoiding investigating mounting allegations of war crimes so much so that the U.S. Senate Committee on the Philippines had been inactive for several months.

Nothing came of the hearings.{{ref|Oregon}}

==Investigation==

===Initial hearings===
[[File:William Howard Taft.jpg|thumb|125px|William Howard Taft]]

[[William Howard Taft|Governor William Howard Taft]] had arrived in the Philippines in June 1900 with the [[Taft Commission]] to set up a civilian government. Taft was the first to testify in the Lodge Committee. As a lawyer, Taft would be assumed to have been a safe witness, but he conceded under questioning that "the torturing of natives by so-called water-cure and other methods" had been used "on some occasions to extract information"..."There are some amusing instances of Filipinos who came in and said they would not say anything unless tortured; that they must have an excuse for what they proposed to say."{{ref|Taft}} As Miller writes, "Very few died from the water cure, a mild form of torture."

Taft was immediately followed by three pro-imperialist witnesses. General [[Robert P. Hughes]], chief of staff to General [[Elwell S. Otis]],{{ref|Bohol}} testified for two weeks in March 1902.{{ref|mar5}}{{ref|mar6}}{{ref|mar8}}{{ref|mar11}}{{ref|2mar11}} In his testimony, Hughes conceded that Filipino houses were burned indiscriminately as a strategy to eliminate shelters and hiding places for guerrillas and as a deterrent. During questioning, Senator [[Charles Henry Dietrich|Charles Dietrich]] followed up by asking Hughes to estimate the value of these houses.  Hughes said they only took a few days to build, and cost between $1.50 and $4.00. Senator [[Joseph Lafayette Rawlins|Joseph Rawlins]] continued the questioning:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Rawlins:'' If these shacks were of no consequence what was the utility of their destruction?&lt;br&gt;
''Hughes:'' The destruction was a punishment. They permitted these people to come in there and conceal themselves and they gave no sign. It is always--&lt;br&gt;
''Rawlins:'' The punishment in that case would fall, not upon the men, who could go elsewhere, but mainly upon the women and little children.&lt;br&gt;
''Hughes:'' The women and children are part of the family, and where you wish to inflict a punishment you can punish the man probably worse in that way than in any other.&lt;br&gt;
''Rawlins:'' But is that within the ordinary rules of civilized warfare? Of course you could exterminate the family which would be still worse punishment.&lt;br&gt;
''Hughes:'' These people are not civilized.&lt;br&gt;
''Rawlins:'' But is that within the ordinary rules of civilized warfare?&lt;br&gt;
''Hughes:'' No; I think it is not.&lt;br&gt;
''Dietrich:'' In order to carry on civilized warfare both sides have to engage in such warfare.&lt;br&gt;
''Hughes:'' Yes sir; certainly that is the point, I think that if I am allowed to go on I will come to a place where I shall have something to say that will bear directly on the subject.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Senator Hale commented that the war had become less and less civilized with each successive commander, to which Hughes agreed saying "from summer to summer, the conduct of the war was sterner, stiffer, as you call it."{{ref|Hughes}}

[[File:David J. Barrows.JPG|thumb|125px|David P. Barrows]]
[[David Prescott Barrows]], school director in the Philippines testified, claiming that anti-imperialist factions in the press had grossly distorted the situation. For example, concentration camps and the [[water cure (torture)|water cure]] were explained in the press as "more terrible than they are." He claimed Filipinos in the camps were "there of their own volition", for they "are pleased with it, because they are permitted to lead an easier life--much easier than at home."  He went on to claim that alleged torture via the water cure "injured no one." While stating his belief that the natives had benefited from the war, Barrows stated he did not "wish to assent to the proposition that war is a good thing ... but where you have a war existing, it is, I think, better to go ahead and pursue it rigorously and finish it."{{ref|Barrows}}

[[File:General otis.JPG|thumb|125px|General Elwell Stephen Otis]]
A fourth witness, [[Elwell S. Otis|General Elwell Stephen Otis]] testified the week of March 20,{{ref|mar20}}{{ref|2mar21}} claiming here had been no warfare in the Philippines for the past two years. Senator Hale questions that statement, saying "there have been a good many fights since." Otis alleged any such fighting was due to "robbers", and that he and his men "were laughed at by the Spaniards and European officers for the humanity that we exercised."{{ref|Otis}} The committee proceeded to take a two-week break before continuing with hearings.{{ref|MacArthur}}

===Hearings continue===
Major [[Cornelius Gardener]], a [[West Point]] graduate serving as provincial governor of [[Tayabas Province|Tayabas]], the province next to [[Batangas]], submitted a report to the committee, which Chairman Lodge laid before the committee on April 10, 1902.{{ref|Gardener1}}

{{quote|Of late by reason of the conduct of the troops, such as the extensive burning of the barrios in trying to lay waste the country so that the insurgents cannot occupy it, the torturing of natives by so-called water cure and other methods, in order to obtain information, the harsh treatment of natives generally, and the failure of inexperienced, lately appointed Lieutenants commanding posts, to distinguish between those who are friendly and those unfriendly and to treat every native as if he were, whether or no, an insurrecto at heart, this favorable sentiment above referred to is being fast destroyed and a deep hatred toward us engendered.

The course now being pursued in this province and in the Provinces of Batangas, Laguna, and Samar is in my opinion sowing the seeds for a perpetual revolution against us hereafter whenever a good opportunity offers. Under present conditions the political situation in this province is slowly retrograding, and the American sentiment is decreasing and we are daily making permanent enemies.{{ref|Gardener}}}}

The Committee on the Philippines refused to subpoena Major Cornelius Gardener in a May 1, party-line vote.{{ref|may1}} Committee members Senator [[Thomas MacDonald Patterson|Thomas Patterson]] decried this move in a speech on the Senate floor. Senator [[Benjamin Tillman]], a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] from [[South Carolina]], similarly objected to this move, claiming information was being "smothered."{{ref|smothered}}

===Emilo Aguinaldo===
Democrats on the committee pressed Lodge to call as witnesses [[Emilio Aguinaldo]], the Filipino general and independence leader, and several others they thought necessary for the committee to hear. In addition to Mr. Aguinaldo, Mr. Rawlings proposed calling [[Apolinario Mabini]], one of Aguinaldo's principal advisors; [[Sixto Lopez]], an advocate for [[Republic Day (Philippines)|Philippine independence]]; Judge [[Pío del Pilar]], General Torres, [[Howard W. Bray]], an Englishman, who has spent many years in the Philippines, [[Robert M. Collins]], and [[Harold Martin (journalist)|Harold Martin]], both [[Associated Press]] correspondents. The committee refused this request as well as one that would have sent a subcommittee to the Philippines to collect testimony.{{ref|NYT1}}{{ref|smothered}}{{ref|may1}}

Instead, Mr. Lodge subpoenaed several veterans from a so-called "safe list" supplied by Secretary of War [[Elihu Root]]. However, when the soldiers appeared, they began to lecture the committee on the necessity of shooting and burning all Filipinos because of their "inability to appreciate human kindness."{{ref|exsoldiers}}

Sergeant L. E. Hallock, Private William J. Gibbs, George C. Boardman, Captain Lee Hall, [[Richard Garrick|Richard Thomas O'Brien]] all testified to what they had seen during their service in the Philippines, including torture of Filipino prisoners, including use of the [[water cure (torture)|water cure]], murder of natives, and other harassment.{{ref|may4}}{{ref|may10}}{{ref|may15}}{{ref|may19}}{{ref|may21}}

Chairman Lodge countered with details of the murder of Private O'Herne. The witness said that in June 1900, O'Herne, with two other members of the company, had been sent to Iloilo for mail, and that on their return, on June 30, they were ambushed by 100 natives, and O'Herne's companions captured. O'Herne had made a dash to get away, and after escaping from the attacking party, had fallen in with other natives supposed to be friendly, but that instead of proving to be so they had devoted the entire next day to his torture and death, beginning at daylight by cutting him with bolos and then roasting him all day by a slow fire, not finishing up until night. All these details had, the witness said, been gathered from the confessions of the men to whom they had given the cure. Sergeant Hallock described the torture of around a dozen natives at the town of [[Leon, Panay]]. He said they were captured and tortured in order to secure information of the murder of Private O'Herne.

Corporal Richard O'Brien, testified he had been present at [[Igbaras]] when the water cure was administered to the Presidente (or chief) of that town. "There was a Spanish woman in town--a woman of education--who was attacked by the American officers."  The witness said he could not give the names of the officers, adding that he had not witnessed the incident, but that the woman's husband was his authority for the statement." O'Brien further testified that there was an "unwritten law out there to take no prisoners."  He said [[Dum-dum|"dum dum" bullets]], or expanding bullets, were issued in the regular way with other ammunition.  He had seen them strike a man and take the top of this head off.

===General Arthur MacArthur===
[[File:Arthur MacArthur Jr.jpg|thumb|125px|Arthur MacArthur, Jr.]]
General MacArthur testified before the committee twice. On April 13, he initially discussed the short war with the Spaniards and the American cooperation with the Filipinos.{{ref|apr13}} Then later that month, he testified again, regarding the capture of [[Emilio Aguinaldo]].{{ref|apr30}}{{ref|may1}}{{ref|may2}}{{ref|may3}} The General testified he had used deception to capture Mr. Aguinaldo, saying "I am responsible in that matter in every way and particular. It was one of the deceptions frequently practiced in war, and whatever deception attached thereto, I take." He attributed the plan to  Gen. Funston, but said he (MacArthur) was responsible for approving the plant. However, he insisted doing so did not violate the rules of civilized warfare. MacArthur also distanced himself from any alleged orders of General [[Jacob H. Smith]] to turn [[Samar]] a howling wilderness.

MacArthur said that absolute chaos would result should the Filipinos be given complete independence and the United States entirely withdraw from the islands. Aguinaldo also had told him it would be impossible at this stage of their evolution for his own people to establish a stable independent Government. He said Aguinaldo was at the time of the conversation a "qualified prisoner", but that there was no coercion or duress resorted to extract the statement.

In regards to the death toll in the Philippines, he said, "The destruction is simply incident to war, and of course embraces a very small percentage of the total population, which is dense." In response, Senator Patterson noted that the death toll in one province was nearly a third. Gen. MacArthur spoke of the capture of papers from high Filipino officials in which the information was contained that, if President McKinley should be re-elected, the insurgents would surrender to the authority of the United States.{{ref|MacArthur2}}

===Alleged war crimes===

====Concentration camps====
Colonel Arthur L. Wagner, the [[U.S. Army|Army's]] chief public relations officer,{{ref|Wagner}} had spent two and a half years in the Philippines. Wagner testified in May, where he was questioned about [[concentration camps]] in the Philippines,{{ref|may29}} 31{{ref|may30}} including deaths at the camps. In one camp, it was reported that the people were assembled according to villages, so that the people in all cases would have their old neighbors near them. So far as he had been able to observe, there was no evidence of want among the people there congregated. Moreover, they were surprisingly contented. Such camps, he insisted, were created to "protect friendly natives from the insurgents" and to "assure them an adequate food supply", while also teaching them "proper sanitary standards."{{ref|Wagner}} People were limited to travel within 300 to 800 yards of the camp, beyond which was a so-called "dead line" that anyone caught crossing would be shot, though he claimed the standing order was not to shoot any helpless persons, or any others if the shooting could be avoided.

Colonel Wagner said that one of the principal purposes of concentrating the native people in the Philippines was to protect them against the [[Wanshan Archipelago|Ladrones]], which had been admirably accomplished. Another object of the camps had been that of facilitating the collection of the rice supplies in order to starve out the Ladrones and guerrillas. The result had been that hostile parties had practically disappeared and their leader, Malvar, had been captured. The policy had been necessary to "protect life and property, and he did not see how any other policy could have been successful. He said that the people were fed and given medical supplies, and the sanitation of the camps was looked after. He insisted that American camps in the Philippines no more could be compared to [[Valeriano Weyler]]'s [[reconcentrado camps]] in Cuba than mercy could be compared to cruelty.

Over loud Republican protests, [[Charles Allen Culberson|Senator Culberson]] began to read a letter from one of [[J. Franklin Bell]]'s officers, which had been quoted in the Senate by Mr. Bacon, in which the officer described a concentration camp as a "suburb of hell." The chair ruled that unless the senator identified the author, who had asked to remain anonymous, it was "hearsay evidence" and directed the witness not to comment on it. But Culberson had already read part of the letter:

&lt;blockquote&gt;What a farce it all is ... this little spot of black sogginess is a reconcentrado pen, with a dead line outside, beyond which everything living is shot ... Upon arrival, I found 30 cases of smallpox, and average fresh ones of five a day, which practically have to be turned out to die. At nightfall crowds of huge vampire bats softly swirl out of their orgies over the dead. Mosquitos work in relays. This corpse-carcass stench wafts in and combined with some lovely municipal odors besides makes it slightly unpleasant here.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Torture of Filipinos====
Col. Wagner said he had no personal knowledge of the tortures of the natives in the Philippines, but he gave several instances in which he had heard reports of torture. In most of these it was found on examination that the reports either were untrue or exaggerated.

Wagner said that he knew that one village had been burned because the citizens would not give information of the murderers of a native friendly to the United States.

After intense cross examination, Wagner agreed that some "innocents" had suffered in the Philippines, but he added that the same was true of every war and that it was an injustice as old as man.  "The Almighty destroyed Sodom, notwithstanding the fact there were a few just people in that community." Senator [[Albert J. Beveridge|Albert Beveridge]] replied, "I was thinking of that instance of Sodom and Gomorrah."{{ref|Wagner}}

===Senator Beveridge's conclusions===

Senator Albert Beveridge published a separate senate document containing his views on the committee, published as Senate Document 422 in the [[57th Congress]], 1st session. Historian Miller criticized this secondary publication, calling it a "deceitful [[cut and paste job]] ... gleaning from the record anything that remotely supported his conclusion that the war was one of the most humane ones in history ... [Beveridge felt that] the Lodge committee had destroyed the malicious fiction of "the slanders of the Army".{{ref|whitewash}}

A petition from five leading anti-imperialists calling for an ad hoc congressional committee to go to the Philippines and investigate conditions there was ignored.  Beveridge had the last word in the "investigation" by gleaning from the record anything that remotely supported his conclusion that the war was one of the most humane ones in history and then publishing this deceitful cut-and-paste job as a separate senate document. (S. Doc. 422, 57th Congress., 1st Session) As far as Beveridge was concerned, the Lodge committee had destroyed the malicious fiction of "the slanderers of the Army."&lt;/span&gt;

'''Controversies of the [[Polish-Soviet War]]''', fought in 1919–20, concerning the behaviour of the military forces and crimes they committed. Each side charged the other with violations of [[international law]] in an effort to sway public opinion in the [[Triple Entente|West]], which was felt to be important for both sides.

==Prisoners of war==
During this war between two countries experiencing great socioeconomic difficulties, and often unable to care for their own populations, the treatment of [[prisoners of war]] was far from adequate,&lt;ref name="Moscow2004"&gt;{{in lang|ru}} [[Waldemar Rezmer]], [[Zbigniew Karpus]], [[Gennadij Matvejev]], ''"Krasnoarmieitsy v polskom plenu v 1919–1922 g.

==Atrocities==
The Polish side claimed that during the Soviet retreat from [[Berdychiv]], [[Kiev]] and [[Zhytomyr]] mass hostage-taking of civilians occurred, with hostages forced to go with the Red Army all the way to the rear of the front.&lt;ref name=Melt&gt;{{cite book | author=Мельтюхов, Михаил Иванович ([[Mikhail Meltyukhov]])| title=Советско-польские войны.

In January 1918 in Cichinicze near [[Mohylow]] Bolsheviks shot patients and personnel of a Polish hospital.&lt;ref name="Dob"&gt;Janina Kurowska.

Last accessed on 11 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Behind Polish lines, Soviet forces hanged suspected enemies on the spot.&lt;ref name="WattQuote"&gt;'''Having burst through the front, Budyonny's cavalry would devastate the enemy's rear – burning, killing and looting as they went. These Red cavalrymen inspired an almost numbing sense of fear in their opponents [...] the very names Budyonny and Cossack terrified the Ukrainian population, and they moved into a state of neutrality or even hostility toward Petliura and the Poles..."'''&lt;br&gt;from Richard Watt, 1979. Bitter Glory: Poland and its fate 1918–1939. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster. {{ISBN|0-671-22625-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, in the pacification of Ukraine that began during the Soviet counteroffensive in 1920 and which would not end until 1922, the Soviets would take tens of thousands of Ukrainian lives.&lt;ref name="BlackBook"&gt;[[Stephanie Courtois|Courtois, Stephane]]; [[Nicolas Werth|Werth, Nicolas]]; [[Jean-Louis Panne|Panne, Jean-Louis]]; [[Andrzej Paczkowski|Paczkowki, Andrzej]]; [[Karel Bartoszek|Bartosek, Karel]]; [[Jean-Louis Margolin|Margolin, Jean-Louis]] (1999).

There were also accusations against [[Stanisław Bułak-Bałachowicz]], a former officer of the [[Imperial Russia]]n and Bolsheviks armies, who switched sides in the conflict and became a general in Poland. Although Bułak-Bałachowicz was regarded as a national hero to [[Belarusians]] in Poland for protecting them against Bolshevik terror, and his refusal to kill peasants on orders from Soviets,&lt;ref name="DB"&gt;[http://www.bialorus.pl/index.php?pokaz=polscy_bialorusini&amp;&amp;Rozdzial=polscy_bialorusini&amp;&amp;wiecej=8229 Dzień Bohaterów na Białostocczyźnie] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061009165425/http://www.bialorus.pl/index.php?pokaz=polscy_bialorusini&amp;&amp;Rozdzial=polscy_bialorusini&amp;&amp;wiecej=8229 |date=2006-10-09 }}, Aleksy Moroz, 2004.

I witnessed throwing the cut-off heads of Bolsheviks under his feet... The massacre of Bolsheviks was horrific"''.&lt;ref name=Melt/&gt;

===Pogroms===
In 1919, Russian Jews were caught in the middle of a civil war, and became the victims of warring Red and White Russian, Ukrainian and Polish forces, among others, resulting in the loss of an estimated 100,000 Jewish lives.&lt;ref&gt;Institute of Contemporary Jewry, Jonathan Frankel et al., eds.

[[Isaac Babel]], a war correspondent embedded with the [[Red Army]], in his 1920 diary wrote down many first-hand accounts of atrocities committed by both sides against Jews (Most of them were retreating Red Army in Ukrainian Front).&lt;ref name=Babel&gt;Isaac Babel, ''1920 Diary'', Yale, 2002, {{ISBN|0-300-09313-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 April 1919 in [[Pinsk]], a Polish officer, after hearing reports that Jewish inhabitants of the city were preparing to riot, panicked and ordered the execution of thirty-five Jews ([[Pinsk massacre]]).&lt;ref name="Michlic"&gt;[[Joanna Beata Michlic]], ''Poland's Threatening Other: The Image of the Jew from 1880 to the Present'', University of Nebraska Press, 2006, {{ISBN|0-8032-3240-3}} [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0803232403&amp;id=t6h2pI7o_zQC&amp;pg=RA4-PA118&amp;lpg=RA4-PA118&amp;ots=xijChxBTMJ&amp;dq=Lida+Dabrowski&amp;sig=NczNKzboFjdGBDwgLWoJ0lGALHk Google Print, p.118]&lt;/ref&gt; Similar hostilities, resulting in fewer casualties, took place in other towns. In Lida soldiers stopped several elderly Jews and cut off their beards with sabres and knives.&lt;ref name="Michlic"/&gt; During the pillage of Lida, Jewish homes were looted and 30 Jews were killed. Violence against Jews caused a major uproar and condemnation in the [[Parliament of Poland|Polish Parliament]]. [[Ignacy Daszyński]], leader of the [[Polish Socialist Party]] called all soldiers that committed acts of violence against the Jewish population "hooligans in uniform".&lt;ref name="Michlic"/&gt; However, Minister of War General [[Józef Leśniewski]], in his written reply to the speaker of Parliament, defended anti-Jewish violence by Polish units in Lida, referring to Jews as a Communist-minded community and stating that the Polish Army had the right to kill their adversaries.&lt;ref name="Michlic"/&gt;

However, reports of these incidents caused the United States to send a commission led by [[Henry Morgenthau, Sr.]] and Sir [[Stuart M. Samuel]] to investigate. According to [[Morgenthau Report|the findings]] of this Anglo-American Investigating Commission, a total of about 300 Jews lost their lives in all incidents involving Poles. The commission also found that the Polish military and civil authorities did their best to prevent such incidents and their recurrence in the future. The Morgenthau report stated that some forms of discrimination against Jews was of political rather than anti-Semitic nature and specifically avoided use of the term "pogrom," noting that the term was used to apply to a wide range of excesses, and had no specific definition.&lt;ref&gt;Andrzej Kapiszewski, [http://www.studiajudaica.pl/sj14kapi.pdf Controversial Reports on the  Situation of the Jews in Poland in the Aftermath of World War ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006100322/http://www.studiajudaica.pl/sj14kapi.pdf |date=2007-10-06 }} ''Studia Judaica'' 7: 2004 nr 2(14) s. 257–304 (pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist [[Tadeusz Piotrowski (sociologist)|Tadeusz Piotrowski]] noted that the Morgenthau Report admitted that the word "pogrom" was inapplicable to the conditions existing within a war zone. [[Richard C. Lukas]] argues that in some places, Jews had made themselves vulnerable by collaborating with Poland's Lithuanian and Soviet enemies.&lt;ref name="Piotrowski-41-42"/&gt;

==Property destruction==
Both sides in the conflict raised complaints about property destruction in diplomatic notes addressed to the [[Triple Entente|Entente]]. One note raised by the Soviet side stated that during the Soviet advance the retreating Poles engaged in "vengeful vandalism", as in [[Borisov (Belarus)|Borisov]] where the Poles, following their retreat, shelled the city with artillery from the opposite bank of the [[Berezina River]] "killing hundreds of people and leaving thousands without shelter."&lt;ref name="Melt"/&gt;

Another joint diplomatic note issued by Soviet Ukraine and Soviet Russia to the [[Triple Entente|Entente]] blamed the Poles for heavily damaging Kiev, including its civilian infrastructure and art, such as [[St Volodymyr's Cathedral]],&lt;ref name="Melt"/&gt; a charge the Poles denied, admitting only to the destruction of the [[Kiev bridges]],&lt;ref name="bridges"&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.ukraine-observer.com/articles/193/324 | title= Fording the Dnipro.

That particular note seems to be based on a telegram by [[Leon Trotsky]], who later admitted that the information he received on [[St Volodymyr's Cathedral]] was incorrect.&lt;ref name="Trotsky"&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1920/military/ch38.htm#fw01 Postal Telegram No. 2886-a, footnote 1].

Around the same time, two days after breaking through the Polish front line – [[Budyonny]]'s 1st Army destroyed the bridges in [[Zhytomyr]], wrecked the railway station and burned various buildings;&lt;ref name="Davies_WERS-123-124pl"&gt;Davies, ''White Eagle...'', Polish edition, pp. 123-124&lt;/ref&gt; Budyonny's troops would continue to spread terror and wreck infrastructure over the coming month in western Ukraine and eastern Poland, to delay the Polish army and disrupt its logistics.&lt;ref name="Watt"&gt;Richard Watt, 1979.

{{Use American English|date=January 2019}}

{{Use mdy dates|date=January 2019}}

The '''International Military Tribunal for the Far East Charter''' (IMTFE Charter), also known as the '''Tokyo Charter''', was the decree issued by General [[Douglas MacArthur]], [[Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers]] in [[Allies of World War II|Allied]]-[[Occupation of Japan|occupied Japan]], on January 19th, 1946 that set down the laws and procedures by which the [[Tokyo Trials]] were to be conducted. The charter was issued months following the [[surrender of Japan]] on September 2nd, 1945, which brought [[World War II]] to an end.&lt;ref name="MAC"&gt;{{cite book |title=Crimes Against Humanity in International Criminal Law |date=July 27, 1999 |page=32 |author=M. Cherif Bassiouni |publisher=[[Wolters Kluwer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modeled after the [[Nuremberg Charter]], the Tokyo Charter stipulated that crimes of the Japanese could be tried. Three categories of crimes were defined: [[crimes against peace]], [[war crime]]s, and [[crimes against humanity]]. Article 6 of the Tokyo Charter also stated that holding an official position or acting pursuant to [[Superior Orders|order of his government or of a superior]] was no defense to war crimes, but that such circumstances may be considered in mitigation of punishment if the Tribunal determines that justice so requires.

Like the [[Nuremberg Trials]], the [[criminal procedure]] used by the Tokyo Trials was closer to [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] than to [[common law]], with a trial before a panel of judges rather than a [[jury trial]] and with wide allowance for [[hearsay]] evidence. Defendants who were found guilty could [[appeal]] the verdict to the [[Allied Council for Japan]]. In addition, they would be permitted to present evidence in their defense and to [[cross-examination|cross-examine]] witnesses.

Unlike the Nuremberg Charter, the Tokyo Charter was not part of a treaty or agreement among the Allies but it was substantially the same as the Nuremberg Charter. A major exception was that Emperor [[Hirohito]] was excluded from being tried for crimes against peace, war crimes, and crimes against humanity.

The Tokyo Charter differs from the Nuremberg Charter, however, in two ways. The Tokyo Charter adds the categories of persons to be held responsible and it does not make "persecution" subject to "religious" grounds. The first variance is only in the drafting of Article 5(c) of the Tokyo Charter defining crimes against humanity since the same responsibility basis exists in the Charter thought not in Article 6(c) of the Nuremberg Charter. The second variance is because the [[The Holocaust|Nazi crimes against the Jews]] did not have a counterpart in the Asian conflict.

The Nuremberg and Tokyo Charters were applicable only to major criminals, leaving other criminals to be tried by the Allies. In Germany, the Allies acted pursuant to Control Council Law No. 10 (CCL 10)&lt;ref&gt;[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/imt/imt10.asp Nuremberg Trials Final Report Appendix D: Control Council Law No. 10]&lt;/ref&gt; in their respective zones of occupation. But they also relied on their military and national tribunals, where they applied their own laws. There was no counterpart in Japan to CCL 10 because the United States was the sole occupying power of Japan, whereas Germany was occupied by the four major Allies (United States, Great Britain, France, and the Soviet Union). The same legal issues pertaining to Article 6(c) of the Nuremberg Charter also apply to Article 5(c) of the Tokyo Charter.&lt;ref name=MAC /&gt;

{{Criminology and penology|crimes}}
'''Crimes against humanity''' are certain acts that are purposely committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian or an identifiable part of a civilian population. The first prosecution for crimes against humanity took place at the [[Nuremberg trials]]. Crimes against humanity have since been prosecuted by other international courts (for example, the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]], the [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] and the [[International Criminal Court]]) as well as in domestic prosecutions. The law of crimes against humanity has primarily developed through the evolution of [[customary international law]]. Crimes against humanity are not codified in an international convention, although there is currently an international effort to establish such a treaty, led by the [[Crimes Against Humanity Initiative]].

Unlike [[war crime]]s, crimes against humanity can be committed during peace or war.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret M. DeGuzman,[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1745183 "Crimes Against Humanity"] ''Research Handbook on International Criminal Law'', Bartram S. Brown, ed., Edgar Elgar Publishing, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; They are not isolated or sporadic events, but are part either of a government policy (although the perpetrators need not identify themselves with this policy) or of a wide practice of atrocities tolerated or condoned by a government or a [[de facto]] authority. [[War crime]]s, [[murder]], [[massacre]]s, [[dehumanization]], [[genocide]], [[ethnic cleansing]], [[deportation]]s, [[unethical human experimentation]], [[extrajudicial punishment]]s including [[summary execution]]s, use of [[Weapon of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]], [[state terrorism]] or [[State-sponsored terrorism|state sponsoring of terrorism]], [[death squad]]s, [[kidnapping]]s and [[forced disappearance]]s, [[Children in the military|use of child soldiers]], [[internment|unjust imprisonment]], [[slavery|enslavement]], [[torture]], [[rape]], [[political repression]], [[Institutional racism|racial discrimination]], [[religious persecution]] and other [[Human rights#Violations|human rights abuses]] may reach the threshold of crimes against humanity if they are part of a widespread or systematic practice.

==History of the term==

The term "crimes against humanity" is potentially [[ambiguous]] because of the ambiguity of the word "humanity", which can mean [[humankind]] (all human beings collectively) or [[humanity (virtue)|the value of humanness]]. The history of the term shows that the latter sense is intended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=David |last=Luban |title=A Theory of Crimes Against Humanity |url=http://scholarship.law.georgetown.edu/facpub/146/ |journal=[[The Yale Journal of International Law]] |volume=29 |number=1 |date=2004 |pages=85–167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abolition of the slave trade===
There were several bilateral treaties in 1814 that foreshadowed the multilateral treaty of [[Final Act of the Congress of Vienna]] (1815) that used wording expressing condemnation of the [[slave trade]] using moral language. For example, the [[Treaty of Paris (1814)]] between Britain and France included the wording "principles of natural justice"; and the British and United States plenipotentiaries stated in the [[Treaty of Ghent (1814)]] that the slave trade violated the "principles of humanity and justice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Martin |first=Francisco Forrest |year=2007 |title=The Constitution as Treaty: The International Legal Constructionalist Approach to the U.S. Constitution |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9781139467186 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=xNEjqp2A6ZgC&amp;pg=PA101#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 101]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The multilateral ''Declaration of the Powers, on the Abolition of the Slave Trade, of 8 February 1815'' (Which also formed [[s:Final Act of the Congress of Vienna/Act XV|Section XV]] of the [[Final Act of the Congress of Vienna|Final Act]] of the [[Congress of Vienna]] of the same year) included in its first sentence the concept of the "principles of humanity and universal morality" as justification for ending a trade that was "odious in its continuance".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Plenipotentiaries of the treaty |title=The Parliamentary Debates from the Year 1803 to the Present Time |publisher= s.n. |year=1816|volume=32 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=I8ETAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=P74#PPT24,M1 p. 200]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First use===

The term "crimes against humanity" was used by [[George Washington Williams]] in a pamphlet published in 1890 to describe the practices of [[Leopold II of Belgium]]'s administration of the [[Congo Free State]].&lt;ref&gt;Hochschild, A. ''King Leopold's Ghost: A Story of Greed, Terror and Heroism in Colonial Africa''. Houghton Mifflin, 1999. p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; In treaty law, the term originated in the Second Hague Convention of 1899 preamble and was expanded in the Fourth Hague Convention of 1907 preamble and their respective regulations, which were concerned with the codification of new rules of [[international humanitarian law]]. The preamble of the two Conventions referenced the "laws of humanity" as an expression of underlying inarticulated humanistic values.&lt;ref&gt;Cherif Bassiouni, M. ''Crimes against Humanity: Historical Evolution and Contemporary Application''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2011. p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; The term is part of what is known as the [[Martens Clause]].

On May 24, 1915, the Allied Powers, Britain, France, and Russia, jointly issued a statement explicitly charging for the first time ever another government of committing "a crime against humanity". An excerpt from this joint statement reads:

{{quote|In view of these new crimes of [[Ottoman Empire]] against humanity and civilization, the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Governments]] announce publicly to the [[Sublime Porte]] that they will hold personally responsible for these crimes all members of the [[Young Turks|Ottoman Government]], as well as those of their agents who are implicated in such massacres.&lt;ref&gt;1915 declaration

&lt;/ref&gt;}}

At the conclusion of the war, an international war crimes commission recommended the creation of a [[tribunal]] to try "violations of the laws of humanity". However, the US representative objected to references to "law of humanity" as being imprecise and insufficiently developed at that time and the concept was not pursued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cryer|first=Robert|title=An Introduction to International Criminal Law and Procedure|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=188|author2=Hakan Friman |author3=Darryl Robinson |author4=Elizabeth Wilmshurst }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Nonetheless, a UN report in 1948 referred to the usage of the term "crimes against humanity" in regard to the Armenian massacres as a precedent to the [[Nuremberg trials|Nürnberg]] and Tokyo Charters. On May 15, 1948, the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|Economic and Social Council]] presented a 384-pages report prepared by the [[United Nations War Crimes Commission]] (UNWCC),&lt;ref name="W.19"&gt;{{cite web|title=E/CN.4/W.19|url= http://undocs.org/E/CN.4/W.19 | publisher=UN.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; set up in London (October 1943) to collect and collate information on war crimes and war criminals.&lt;ref name="Avedian2018" /&gt; {{rp|129}} The report was in compliance to the request by the UN Secretary-General to make arrangements for "the collection and publication of information concerning human rights arising from trials of war criminals, quislings and traitors, and in particular from the [[Nuremberg trials|Nürnberg]] and [[International Military Tribunal for the Far East|Tokyo Trials]]." The report had been prepared by members of the Legal Staff of the Commission. The report is highly topical in regard to the Armenian Genocide, not only because it uses the 1915 events as a historic example, but also as a precedent to the Articles 6 (c) and 5 (c) of the [[Nuremberg Charter|Nuremberg]] and [[Tokyo Charter]]s, and thereby as a precursor to the then newly adopted UN [[Genocide Convention]], differentiating between war crimes and crimes against humanity. By refereeing to the information collected during WWI and put forward by the 1919 [[Commission of Responsibilities]], the report entitled "Information Concerning Human Rights Arising from Trials of War Criminals" used the Armenian case as a vivid example of committed crimes by a state against its own citizens. The report also noted that while the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Treaties]] with Germany, Austria, Hungary and Bulgaria, did not include any reference to "laws of humanity", instead basing the charges on violations of "[[law of war|laws and customs of war]]", The [[Treaty of Sèvres|Sèvres Peace Treaty]] with Turkey did so. In addition to the Articles 226–228, concerning customs of war (corresponding to Articles 228–230 of the [[Treaty of Versailles]]), the Sèvres Treaty also contained an additional Article 230, obviously in compliance with the Allied ultimatum of May 24, 1915 in regard to committed "crimes against humanity and civilization".&lt;ref name="Avedian2018"&gt;{{cite book | last=Avedian | first=Vahagn | title=Knowledge and Acknowledgement in the Politics of Memory of the Armenian Genocide | url=https://books.google.se/books?id=Tv7iuQEACAAJ | year=2018|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-13-831885-4}} {{rp|130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nuremberg trials===
{{Main article|Nuremberg trials}}
[[File:Defendants in the dock at the Nuremberg Trials.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Nuremberg Trials. Defendants in the dock. The main target of the prosecution was [[Hermann Göring]] (at the left edge on the first row of benches), considered to be the most important surviving official in the [[Nazi Germany|Third ''Reich'']] after [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler's]] death.]]

After the Second World War, the [[London Charter of the International Military Tribunal]] set down the laws and procedures by which the Nuremberg trials were to be conducted. The drafters of this document were faced with the problem of how to respond to [[the Holocaust]] and the grave crimes committed by the [[Nazi regime]]. A traditional understanding of war crimes gave no provision for crimes committed by a power on its own citizens. Therefore, Article 6 of the Charter was drafted to include not only traditional war crimes and [[crime against peace|crimes against peace]], but also ''crimes against humanity'', defined as
{{quote|[[Murder]], extermination, [[Slavery|enslavement]], [[deportation]], and other [[wikt:inhumane|inhumane]] acts committed against any [[civilian]] population, before or during the war, or persecutions on political, racial or religious grounds in execution of or in connection with any crime within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, whether or not in violation of the domestic law of the country where perpetrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nuremberg War Crimes Trial: The Charter Provisions|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/imt/judprov.asp |website=avalon.law.yale.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="black book"&gt;Nicolas Werth, Karel Bartošek, Jean-Louis Panné, Jean-Louis Margolin, Andrzej Paczkowski, [[Stéphane Courtois]], ''[[The Black Book of Communism]]: Crimes, Terror, Repression'', [[Harvard University Press]], 858 pages, {{ISBN|0-674-07608-7}}, page 6.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Under this definition, crimes against humanity could only be punished insofar as they could be connected somehow to war crimes or crimes against peace.&lt;ref name=Hilberg1145/&gt; The jurisdictional limitation was explained by the American chief representative to the London Conference, [[Robert H. Jackson]], who pointed out that it "has been a general principle from time immemorial that the internal affairs of another government are not ordinarily our business". Thus, "it is justifiable that we interfere or attempt to bring retribution to individuals or to states only because the concentration camps and the deportations were in pursuance of a common plan or enterprise of making an unjust war".&lt;ref name=Hilberg1145&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hilberg|first1=Raul|title=The Destruction of the European Jews|date=2003|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, CT|isbn=9780300095579|edition=3rd|pages=1145–1147}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judgement of the first Nuremberg trial found that "the policy of persecution, repression and murder of civilians" and persecution of Jews within Germany before the outbreak of war in 1939 were not crimes against humanity, because as "revolting and horrible as many of these crimes were, it has not been satisfactorily proved that they were done in execution of, or in connection with," war crimes or crimes against peace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/imt/judlawre.asp Judgement : The Law Relating to War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity] contained in the [[Avalon Project]] archive at [[Yale Law School]]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[subsequent Nuremberg trials]] were conducted under Control Council Law No. 10 which included a revised definition of crimes against humanity with a wider scope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wolfe |first1=Robert |title=Flaws in the Nuremberg Legacy: An Impediment to International War Crimes Tribunals' Prosecution of Crimes Against Humanity |journal=Holocaust and Genocide Studies |date=1 January 1998 |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=443–444 |doi=10.1093/hgs/12.3.434}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tokyo Trial===
{{See also|International Military Tribunal for the Far East}}

[[File:IMTFE defendants.jpg|thumb|300px|The defendants at the Tokyo International Tribunal.  General [[Hideki Tojo]] was one of the main defendants, and is in the centre of the middle row.]]

The International Military Tribunal for the Far East (IMTFE), also known as the Tokyo Trial, was convened to [[criminal procedure|try]] the leaders of the [[Empire of Japan]] for three types of crimes: "Class A" ([[crimes against peace]]), "Class B" ([[war crime]]s), and "Class C" (crimes against humanity), committed during the Second World War.

The legal basis for the trial was established by the [[Tokyo Charter|Charter of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East (CIMTFE)]] that was proclaimed on 19 January 1946. The tribunal convened on May 3, 1946, and was adjourned on November 12, 1948.

In the Tokyo Trial, Crimes against Humanity (Class C) was not applied for any suspect.&lt;ref&gt;Yoshinobu Higurashi,Tokyo Saiban(Tokyo Trial),Kodansya-Gendai-Shinsho,Kodansha Limited,2008,p.26,pp.116–119.Hirohumi Hayashi,BC kyu Senpan Saiban,Iwanami Shoten Publishers,2005,p.33.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Additional citation needed|date=April 2016}}  Prosecutions related to the [[Nanking Massacre]] were categorised as infringements upon the [[Laws of War]].&lt;ref&gt;Yoshinobu Higurashi,op.cit.,pp.116–119.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Additional citation needed|date=April 2016}}

A panel of eleven [[judge]]s presided over the IMTFE, one each from victorious Allied powers ([[United States]], [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]], [[Soviet Union]], [[United Kingdom]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Provisional Government of the French Republic]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Canada]], [[British India]], and the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|Philippines]]).

==Types of crimes against humanity==
The different types of crimes which may constitute crimes against humanity differs between definitions both internationally and on the domestic level. Isolated inhumane acts of a certain nature committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack may instead constitute grave infringements of [[human rights]], or –&amp;nbsp;depending on the circumstances&amp;nbsp;– [[war crimes]], but are not classified as crimes against humanity.&lt;ref name="Horton"&gt;As quoted by Guy Horton in ''[http://www.ibiblio.org/obl/docs3/Horton-2005.pdf Dying Alive – A Legal Assessment of Human Rights Violations in Burma]'' April 2005, co-Funded by The Netherlands Ministry for Development Co-Operation. See section "12.52 Crimes against humanity", Page 201. He references RSICC/C, Vol. 1 p. 360&lt;/ref&gt;

===Apartheid===
{{Main article|Crime of apartheid}}

The systematic persecution of one racial group by another, such as occurred during the [[South Africa]]n [[apartheid]] government, was recognized as a crime against humanity by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anc.org.za/un/uncrime.htm International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091011235327/http://www.anc.org.za/un/uncrime.htm |date=October 11, 2009 }} dopted and opened for signature, ratification by General Assembly resolution 3068 (XXVIII) of 30 November 1973. Entry into force 18 July 1976, in accordance with article X (10)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Charter of the United Nations]] (Article 13, 14, 15) makes actions of the General Assembly advisory to the Security Council.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/aboutun/charter/index.html "Charter of the United Nations"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417093634/http://www.un.org/aboutun/charter/index.html |date=April 17, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In regard to apartheid in particular, the UN General Assembly has not made any findings, nor have apartheid-related trials for crimes against humanity been conducted.

===Rape and sexual violence===
Neither the Nuremberg or Tokyo Charters contained an explicit provision recognizing sexual and gender-based crimes as war crimes or crimes against humanity, although Control Council Law No. 10 recognized rape as a crime against humanity. The statutes of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda both included rape as a crime against humanity. The ICC is the first international instrument expressly to include various forms of sexual and gender-based crimes{{snd}} including rape, sexual slavery, enforced prostitution, forced pregnancy, enforced sterilisation, and other forms of sexual violence{{snd}} as both an underlying act of crimes against humanity and war crime committed in international and/or non-international armed conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/otp/OTP-Policy-Paper-on-Sexual-and-Gender-Based-Crimes--June-2014.pdf "ICC Prosecutor's Policy Paper on Sexual and Gender-Based Crimes"] June 2014&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, the events of [[Khojaly Massacre|Khojaly]] and [[Khatyn massacre|Khatyn]] can be shown that the world strongly condemns. International institutions have asked for a ransom to avoid such incidents. There are hundreds of massacres, thousands of prisoners and wounded in these incidents.

In 2008, the [[U.N. Security Council]] adopted [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1820|resolution 1820]], which noted that "rape and other forms of sexual violence can constitute war crimes, crimes against humanity or a constitutive act with respect to genocide".&lt;ref name="Un.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2008/sc9364.doc.htm |title=SECURITY COUNCIL DEMANDS IMMEDIATE AND COMPLETE HALT TO ACTS OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE AGAINST CIVILIANS IN CONFLICT ZONES, UNANIMOUSLY ADOPTING RESOLUTION 1820 (2008) |publisher=Un.org |accessdate=2013-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the [[Crimes Against Humanity Initiative]] was launched by Professor [[Leila Nadya Sadat]] at the [[Whitney R. Harris World Law Institute]] to address this gap in international law. The Initiative represents the first concerted effort to address the gap that exists in international criminal law by enumerating a comprehensive international convention on crimes against humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Gareth, [http://www.crisisgroup.org/en/publication-type/speeches/2009/crimes-against-humanity-and-the-responsibility-to-protect.aspx "Crimes Against Humanity and the Responsibility to Protect"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150105053758/http://www.crisisgroup.org/en/publication-type/speeches/2009/crimes-against-humanity-and-the-responsibility-to-protect.aspx |date=January 5, 2015 }} International Crisis Group&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 30, 2013, the United Nations [[International Law Commission]] voted to include the topic of crimes against humanity in its long-term program of work. In July 2014, the Commission moved this topic to its active programme of work&lt;ref&gt;Cecilia Marcela Bailliet, [http://ilg2.org/2014/08/06/un-international-law-commission-to-elaborate-new-global-convention-on-crimes-against-humanity/ "UN International Law Commission to Elaborate New Global Convention on Crimes Against Humanity"] IntLawGrrls&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William A.

International Law Commission, Sixty-fifth session. p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;  Professor Sean D. Murphy, the United States’ Member on the United Nations’ International Law Commission, has been named the Special Rapporteur for Crimes Against Humanity. Sean D. Murphy attended the 2008 Experts' Meeting held by the Crimes Against Humanity Initiative prior to this appointment.

There is some debate on what the status of crimes against humanity under customary international law is. M. Cherif Bassiouni argues that crimes against humanity are part of ''jus cogens'' and as such constitute a non-derogable rule of international law.&lt;ref name="Crimes Against Humanity"/&gt;

==United Nations==
The United Nations has been primarily responsible for the prosecution of crimes against humanity since it was chartered in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://undocs.org/A/RES/260(III)|title=A/RES/260(III) – E – A/RES/260(III)|website=undocs.org|access-date=2019-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Nuremberg, there was no international court with jurisdiction over crimes against humanity for almost 50 years. Work continued on developing the definition of crimes against humanity at the United Nations, however. In 1947, the [[International Law Commission]] was charged by the United Nations General Assembly with the formulation of the principles of international law recognized and reinforced in the Nuremberg Charter and judgment, and with drafting a 'code of offenses against the peace and security of mankind'. Completed fifty years later in 1996, the Draft Code defined crimes against humanity as various inhumane acts, i.e., "murder, extermination, torture, enslavement, persecution on political, racial, religious or ethnic grounds, institutionalized discrimination, arbitrary deportation or forcible transfer of population, arbitrary imprisonment, rape, enforced prostitution and other inhuman acts committed in a systematic manner or on a large scale and instigated or directed by a Government or by any organization or group." This definition differs from the one used in Nuremberg, where the criminal acts were to have been committed "before or during the war", thus establishing a nexus between crimes against humanity and armed conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.internationalcrimesdatabase.org/Crimes/CrimesAgainstHumanity#_ftnref1 |title=ICD – Crimes against humanity |publisher=Asser Institute |year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A report on the 2008–09 [[Gaza War (2008–09)|Gaza War]] by [[Richard Goldstone]] accused Palestinian and Israeli forces of possibly committing a crime against humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8257301.stm | work=BBC News | title=UN condemns 'war crimes' in Gaza | date=16 September 2009 | accessdate=30 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Goldstone said that he no longer believed that Israeli forces had targeted civilians or committed a crime against humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Goldstone|first=Richard|title=Reconsidering the Goldstone Report on Israel and War Crimes|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/reconsidering-the-goldstone-report-on-israel-and-war-crimes/2011/04/01/AFg111JC_story.html|newspaper=The Washington Post|accessdate=2 August 2012|date=2011-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 March 2013, at its 22nd session, the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] established the [[Report of the Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea|Commission of Inquiry on human rights in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea]] (DPRK). The Commission is mandated to investigate the systematic, widespread and grave violations of human rights in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, with a view to ensuring full accountability, in particular for violations which may amount to crimes against humanity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G13/128/65/PDF/G1312865.pdf?OpenElement "Resolution A/HRC/RES/22/13: Situation of human rights in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130829031840/http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G13/128/65/PDF/G1312865.pdf?OpenElement |date=August 29, 2013 }} Human Rights Council&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission dealt with matters relating to crimes against humanity on the basis of definitions set out by customary international criminal law and in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.&lt;ref name="ohchr.org"&gt;Report of the commission of inquiry on human rights in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea – A/HRC/25/63, available at: {{cite web |url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/CoIDPRK/Pages/Documents.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150425025103/http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/CoIDPRK/Pages/Documents.aspx |archivedate=2015-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2014 Report by the commission found "the body of testimony and other information it received establishes that crimes against humanity have been committed in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, pursuant to policies established at the highest level of the State... These crimes against humanity entail extermination, murder, enslavement, torture, imprisonment, rape, forced abortions and other sexual violence, persecution on political, religious, racial and gender grounds, the forcible transfer of populations, the enforced disappearance of persons and the inhumane act of knowingly causing prolonged starvation. The commission further finds that crimes against humanity are ongoing in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea because the policies, institutions and patterns of impunity that lie at their heart remain in place." Additionally, the commission found that crimes against humanity have been committed against starving populations, particularly during the 1990s, and are being committed against persons from other countries who were systematically abducted or denied repatriation, in order to gain labour and other skills for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.&lt;ref name="ohchr.org"/&gt;

===Security Council===
[[UN Security Council Resolution 1674]], adopted by the [[United Nations Security Council]] on 28 April 2006, "reaffirms the provisions of paragraphs 138 and 139 of the 2005 [[World Summit Outcome Document]] regarding the responsibility to protect populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity".&lt;ref&gt;[http://domino.un.org/UNISPAl.NSF/361eea1cc08301c485256cf600606959/e529762befa456f8852571610045ebef!OpenDocument Resolution 1674 (2006)]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223154915/http://domino.un.org/UNISPAl.NSF/361eea1cc08301c485256cf600606959/e529762befa456f8852571610045ebef%21OpenDocument |date=February 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Nations Security Council Resolution|resolution]] commits the Council to action to protect civilians in armed conflict.

In 2008 the [[U.N. Security Council]] adopted [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1820|resolution 1820]], which noted that "rape and other forms of sexual violence can constitute war crimes, crimes against humanity or a constitutive act with respect to genocide".&lt;ref name="Un.org"/&gt;

According to the [[United Nations Security Council]] resolution 1970 (2011) concerning [[Libya]], any direct or indirect trade of arms to the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, in the form of supply, transfer, or sale should be prevented by the member nations. The [[arms embargo]] restricts the supply of arms, weapons, military vehicles, spare parts, technical assistance, finances, along with the provision of armed [[mercenaries]], with origins of a country other than the one providing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite_web|url=https://www.un.org/securitycouncil/sanctions/1970|title=Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1970 (2011) concerning Libya|website=United Nations Security Council}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite_web|url=https://www.undocs.org/S/RES/1970%20(2011)|title=Resolution 1970 (2011)|website=United Nations Security Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the United Nations claimed in its November 2019 report that the [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Jordan]] and [[Turkey]] are violating the arms embargo imposed on Libya under the 1970 resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-libya-security-un/jordan-uae-turkey-sudan-accused-of-violating-sanctions-on-libya-un-report-idUSKBN1XL2E6|title=Jordan, UAE, Turkey, Sudan accused of violating sanctions on Libya – U.N. report|accessdate=11 November 2019|newspaper=Reuters|date=2019-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; An airstrike on the migrant detention center in [[Tripoli]] in July 2019, believed to have been carried out by the United Arab Emirates, can be amounted as a war crime, as stated by the United Nations.

==International courts and criminal tribunals==
After the Nuremberg and Tokyo trials of 1945–1946, the next international tribunal with jurisdiction over crimes against humanity was not established for another five decades. In response to atrocities committed in the 1990s, multiple ad hoc tribunals were established with jurisdiction over crimes against humanity. The statutes of the International Criminal Court, the International Criminal Tribunals for the Former Yugolavia and for Rwanda each contain different definitions of crimes against humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Burns, Peter, [http://www.icclr.law.ubc.ca/Site%20Map/ICC/AspectofCrimesAgainstHumanity.pdf "Aspect of Crimes Against Humanity and the International Criminal Court"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021031709/http://www.icclr.law.ubc.ca/site%20map/icc/aspectofcrimesagainsthumanity.pdf |date=2012-10-21 }} International Centre for Criminal Law Reform and Criminal Justice Policy. p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia===
{{Main article|International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia}}

In 1993, the UN Security Council established the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), with jurisdiction to investigate and prosecute three international crimes which had taken place in the former Yugoslavia: genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. Article 5 of the ICTY Statute states that {{quotation|The International Tribunal shall have the power to prosecute persons responsible for the following crimes when committed in armed conflict, whether international or internal in character, and directed against any civilian population:&lt;ref name="ICTY Statute"&gt;[http://www.icty.org/x/file/Legal%20Library/Statute/statute_sept09_en.pdf "ICTY Statute"] Article 5&lt;/ref&gt;

:(a) murder;
:(b) extermination;
:(c) enslavement;
:(d) deportation;
:(e) imprisonment;
:(f) torture;
:(g) rape;
:(h) persecutions on political, racial and religious grounds;
:(i) other inhumane acts."}}

This definition of crimes against humanity revived the original ‘Nuremberg’ nexus with armed conflict, connecting crimes against humanity to both international and non-international armed conflict. It also expanded the list of criminal acts used in Nuremberg to include imprisonment, torture and rape.&lt;ref name="ICTY Statute"/&gt; Cherif Bassiouni has argued that this definition was necessary as the conflict in the former Yugoslavia was considered to be a conflict of both an international and non-international nature. Therefore, this adjusted definition of crimes against humanity was necessary to afford the tribunal jurisdiction over this crime.&lt;ref&gt;Cherif Bassiouni, M. Crimes against Humanity: Historical Evolution and Contemporary Application. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2011. p. 186&lt;/ref&gt;

===International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda===
{{Main article|International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda}}

The UN Security Council established the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda in 1994 following the [[Rwandan genocide]]. Under the ICTR Statute, the link between crimes against humanity and an armed conflict of any kind was dropped. Rather, the requirement was added that the inhumane acts must be part of a "systematic or widespread attack against any civilian population on national, political, ethnic, racial or religious grounds."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icls.de/dokumente/ictr_statute.pdf "ICTR Statute"] Article 3&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the conflict in the former Yugoslavia, the conflict in Rwanda was deemed to be non-international, so crimes against humanity would likely not have been applicable if the nexus to armed conflict had been maintained.

In 2002, the [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC) was established in [[The Hague]] (Netherlands) and the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Rome Statute]] provides for the ICC to have jurisdiction over [[genocide]], crimes against humanity and war crimes. The definition of what is a "crime against humanity" for ICC proceedings has significantly broadened from its original legal definition or that used by the UN.&lt;ref name="crimesofwar"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crimesofwar.org/thebook/crimes-against-humanity.html |title=Crimes Against Humanity |accessdate=2006-07-23 |author=Cherif Bassiouni |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060718113035/http://www.crimesofwar.org/thebook/crimes-against-humanity.html |archivedate=2006-07-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, the Rome Statute employs the same definition of crimes against humanity that the ICTR Statute does, minus the requirement that the attack was carried out ‘on national, political, ethnic, racial or religious grounds’. In addition, the Rome Statute definition offers the most expansive list of specific criminal acts that may constitute crimes against humanity to date.

Article 7 of the treaty stated that:

{{quotation|For the purpose of this Statute, "crime against humanity" means any of the following acts when committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population, with knowledge of the attack:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.preventgenocide.org/law/icc/statute/part-a.htm#2 Rome statute of the International Criminal Court] Article 7: Crimes against humanity. [https://www.icc-cpi.int/nr/rdonlyres/ea9aeff7-5752-4f84-be94-0a655eb30e16/0/rome_statute_english.pdf pdf version]&lt;/ref&gt;

:(a) [[Homicide|Murder]];
:(b) Extermination;
:(c) [[Slavery|Enslavement]];
:(d) [[Population transfer|Deportation or forcible transfer of population]];
:(e) [[Imprisonment]] or other severe deprivation of physical liberty in violation of fundamental rules of international law;
:(f) [[Torture]];
:(g) [[War rape|Rape]], [[sexual slavery]], [[forced prostitution|enforced prostitution]], [[forced pregnancy]], [[compulsory sterilization|enforced sterilization]], or any other form of [[sexual violence]] of comparable gravity;
:(h) Persecution against any identifiable group or collectivity on political, [[Human race|racial]], national, ethnic, [[Culture|cultural]], [[Religion|religious]], [[gender]] as defined in paragraph 3, or other grounds that are universally recognized as impermissible under international law, in connection with any act referred to in this paragraph or any crime within the jurisdiction of the Court;
:(i) [[Forced disappearance|Enforced disappearance]] of persons;
:(j) The [[crime of apartheid]];
:(k) Other inhumane acts of a similar character intentionally causing great suffering, or serious injury to body or to mental or physical health;}}

The [[Rome Statute]] Explanatory Memorandum states that crimes against humanity
{{quotation|are particularly odious offenses in that they constitute a serious attack on human dignity or grave humiliation or a degradation of one or more human beings. They are not isolated or sporadic events, but are part either of a government policy (although the perpetrators need not identify themselves with this policy) or of a wide practice of atrocities tolerated or condoned by a government or a de facto authority. However, murder, extermination, torture, rape, political, racial, or religious persecution and other inhumane acts reach the threshold of crimes against humanity only if they are part of a widespread or systematic practice. Isolated inhumane acts of this nature may constitute grave infringements of human rights, or depending on the circumstances, war crimes, but may fall short of meriting the stigma attaching to the category of crimes under discussion. On the other hand, an individual may be guilty of crimes against humanity even if he perpetrates one or two of the offences mentioned above, or engages in one such offense against only a few civilians, provided those offenses are part of a consistent pattern of misbehavior by a number of persons linked to that offender (for example, because they engage in armed action on the same side or because they are parties to a common plan or for any similar reason.) Consequently when one or more individuals are not accused of planning or carrying out a policy of inhumanity, but simply of perpetrating specific atrocities or vicious acts, in order to determine whether the necessary threshold is met one should use the following test: one ought to look at these atrocities or acts in their context and verify whether they may be regarded as part of an overall policy or a consistent pattern of an inhumanity, or whether they instead constitute isolated or sporadic acts of cruelty and wickedness.&lt;ref name="Horton2"&gt;As quoted by Guy Horton in ''[http://www.ibiblio.org/obl/docs3/Horton-2005.pdf Dying Alive – A Legal Assessment of Human Rights Violations in Burma]'' April 2005, co-Funded by The Netherlands Ministry for Development Co-Operation. See section "12.52 Crimes against humanity", p. 201. He references RSICC/C, Vol. 1 p. 360&lt;/ref&gt;}}

To fall under the Rome Statute, a crime against humanity which is defined in Article 7.1 must be "part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population". Article 7.2.a states "For the purpose of paragraph 1: "Attack directed against any civilian population means a course of conduct involving the multiple commission of acts referred to in paragraph 1 against any civilian population, pursuant to or in furtherance of a State or organizational policy to commit such attack." This means that an individual crime on its own, or even a number of such crimes, would not fall under the Rome Statute unless they were the result of a State policy or an organizational policy. This was confirmed by [[Luis Moreno Ocampo]] in an open letter publishing his conclusions about allegations of crimes committed during the invasion of Iraq in March 2003 which might fall under the [[International Criminal Court|ICC]]. In a section entitled "Allegations concerning Genocide and Crimes against Humanity" he states that "the available information provided no reasonable indicator of the required elements for a crime against humanity," i.e. 'a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population'".&lt;ref&gt;[[Luis Moreno Ocampo]]{{cite web|url=http://www.icc-cpi.int/library/organs/otp/OTP_letter_to_senders_re_Iraq_9_February_2006.pdf |title=OTP letter to senders re Iraq |accessdate=2006-02-25 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060225075607/http://www.icc-cpi.int/library/organs/otp/OTP_letter_to_senders_re_Iraq_9_February_2006.pdf |archivedate=2006-02-25 }}  9 February 2006.

The ICC can only prosecute crimes against humanity in situations under which it has jurisdiction. The ICC only has jurisdiction over crimes contained in its statute – genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity – which have been committed on the territory of a State party to the Rome Statute, when a non-party State refers a situation within its country to the court or when the United Nation Security Council refers a case to the ICC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/About+the+Court/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110412060448/http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/About%2Bthe%2BCourt/ |archivedate=2011-04-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 the UN referred to the ICC the situation in Darfur.

==Council of Europe==
The [[Committee of Ministers]] of the [[Council of Europe]] on 30 April 2002 issued a recommendation to the member states, on the protection of women against violence. In the section "Additional measures concerning violence in conflict and post-conflict situations", states in paragraph 69 that member states should: "penalize rape, sexual slavery, forced pregnancy, enforced sterilization or any other form of sexual violence of comparable gravity as an intolerable violation of human rights, as crimes against humanity and, when committed in the context of an armed conflict, as war crimes;"&lt;ref&gt;[[Committee of Ministers]] of the [[Council of Europe]]: [http://www.coe.int/t/e/human_rights/equality/05._violence_against_women/002_Rec(2002)05.asp Recommendation (2002) 5]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061127063047/http://www.coe.int/t/e/human_rights/equality/05._violence_against_women/002_Rec%282002%2905.asp |date=November 27, 2006 }} Paragraph 69&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Explanatory Memorandum on this recommendation when considering paragraph 69:
{{quotation|Reference should be made to the [[Rome Statute|Statute of the International Criminal Tribunal]] adopted in Rome in July 1998. Article 7 of the Statute defines rape, sexual slavery, enforced prostitution, forced pregnancy, enforced sterilization or any other form of sexual violence of comparable gravity, as crimes against humanity. Furthermore, Article 8 of the Statute defines rape, sexual slavery, enforced prostitution, forced pregnancy, enforced sterilization or any other form of sexual violence as a serious breach of the Geneva Conventions and as war crimes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Committee of Ministers]] of the [[Council of Europe]]: [http://www.coe.int/t/e/human_rights/equality/05._violence_against_women/002_Rec(2002)05.asp Recommendation (2002) 5]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061127063047/http://www.coe.int/t/e/human_rights/equality/05._violence_against_women/002_Rec%282002%2905.asp |date=November 27, 2006 }} Paragraph 100&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Holodomor]] has been recognized as a crime against humanity by the [[European Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.rian.ru/world/20081023/117913361.html |title=MEPs recognize Ukraine's famine as crime against humanity  |accessdate=2008-10-23 |website=|publisher=Russian News &amp; Information Agency |date= 2008-10-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UN pointed out the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC) specifically Article 7 (Crimes against Humanity), which defines large-scale acts of violence against a locality's civilian populace. These acts consist of murder; annihilation; enslavement; bondage; forced removal of the population; imprisonment or deprivation of physical liberty that violates international laws; maltreatment; forced prostitution and rape; discrimination and tyranny against certain groups; apartheid (racial discrimination and segregation); and, other inhumane acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://legal.un.org/icc/statute/99_corr/cstatute.htm|title=Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, 1998|last=Pronto|first=Arnold N.|website=legal.un.org|access-date=2018-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; A publication from Trial International mentioned that crimes against humanity have been collated starting in 1990. These were the 1993 Statute of the [[International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia]], 1994 Statute of the [[International Tribunal for Rwanda]], and 1998 [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]]. The latter contains the latest and most extensive list of detailed crimes against civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://trialinternational.org/topics-post/crimes-against-humanity/|title=Crimes Against Humanity – TRIAL International|work=TRIAL International|access-date=2018-06-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bruce's Cave.jpg|thumb|Bruce's cave, one of Rathlin Island's caves, etching by Mrs. Catherine Gage (1851)]]

The '''Rathlin Island massacre''' took place on [[Rathlin Island]], off the coast of [[Ireland]] on 26 July 1575,&lt;ref name=cambridge1&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hadfield |first1=Andrew |last2=Maley |first2=Willy |editor-last=Bradshaw |editor-first=Brendan |title=Representing Ireland: Literature and the Origins of Conflict, 1534-1660 |year=1993 |publisher=Cambridge University Press. |isbn=9780521416344|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780521416344 |url-access=registration |edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt; when more than 600 [[Scottish people|Scots]] and [[Irish people|Irish]] were killed.

==Sanctuary attacked==
Rathlin Island was used as a sanctuary because of its natural defences and rocky shores; when the wind blew from the west, in earlier times it was almost impossible to land.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.booksulster.com/library/sketches/rathlin.php|title=Rathlin Island|website=www.booksulster.com|access-date=2018-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also respected as a hiding place, as it was the one-time abode of [[St. Columba]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Installing themselves in [[Rathlin Castle]], the [[MacDonnell of Antrim|MacDonnells of Antrim]] made Rathlin their base for resistance to the [[Enterprise of Ulster]]. Their military leader, [[Sorley Boy MacDonnell]] (''[[Scottish Gaelic]]'': Somhairle Buidhe Mac Domhnaill) and other Scots had thought it prudent to send their wives, children, elderly, and sick to Rathlin Island for safety.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Acting on the instructions of Sir [[Henry Sidney]] and the [[Walter Devereux, 1st Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]], Sir [[Francis Drake]] and Sir [[John Norreys]] took the castle by storm. Drake used two cannons to batter the castle and when the walls gave in, Norreys ordered direct attack on 25 July, and the Garrison surrendered.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Sir_John_Norreys_and_the_Elizabethan_Mil.html?id=-0NnAAAAMAAJ|title=Sir John Norreys and the Elizabethan Military World|last=Nolan|first=John S.|date=1997-01-01|publisher=University of Exeter Press|isbn=9780859895484|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Norreys set the terms of surrender,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; whereupon the constable, his family, and one of the hostages were given safe passage and all other defending soldiers were killed, and on 26 July 1575, Norreys' forces hunted the old, sick, very young and women who were hiding in the caves.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Despite the surrender, they killed all the 200 defenders and more than 400 civilian men, women and children. Drake was also charged with the task of preventing any Scottish reinforcement vessels reaching the Island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kelsey |first1=Harry |title=Sir Francis Drake: The Queen's Pirate |date=1998 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=0300071825 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/sirfrancisdrakeq00kels/page/71 71-74] |url=https://archive.org/details/sirfrancisdrakeq00kels/page/71 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The entire family of Sorley Boy MacDonnell perished in the massacre.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Essex, who ordered the killings, boasted in a letter to [[Francis Walsingham]], the Queen's secretary and spymaster, that Sorley Boy MacDonnell watched the massacre from the mainland helplessly and was "like to run mad from sorrow".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Sir_Francis_Drake.html?id=JmRnAAAAMAAJ|title=Sir Francis Drake|last=Sugden|first=John|date=1990|publisher=Barrie &amp; Jenkins|isbn=9780712620383|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Norreys stayed on the island and tried to rebuild the walls of the castle so that the English might use the structure as a fortress. As Drake was not paid to defend the island, he departed with his ships. Norreys realised that it was not possible to defend the island without intercepting Scottish galleys and he returned to [[Carrickfergus]] in September 1575.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== History ==
In 1998, at the Rome Conference that adopted the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]] ("the Statute"), the crime was included as one of the crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court (Article 5.1) and over which any State that becomes party to the Statute accepts the Court's jurisdiction (Article 12.1). However, participants to the Rome Conference could not agree on the definition of the crime nor on further conditions for the Court's exercise of jurisdiction; the Statute did not allow the Court to exercise such jurisdiction until these outstanding issues were solved (Article 5.2). At the 2010 [[Review Conference of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Review Conference]] ("the Conference"), States Parties agreed by consensus to adopt resolution RC/Res.6 accepting the amendments to the Statute adding the definition of the crime and the conditions for the exercise of jurisdiction over this crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/asp_docs/Resolutions/RC-Res.6-ENG.pdf|title=Resolution RC/Res.6 !|accessdate=14 May 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320072358/http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/asp_docs/Resolutions/RC-Res.6-ENG.pdf|archivedate=20 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Adopted amendments ===
* The adopted [[Amendments to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|amendments to the Rome Statute]] included deletion of Article 5.2 of the Rome Statute that formerly stated "The Court shall exercise jurisdiction over the crime of aggression once a provision is adopted in accordance with articles 121 and 123 defining the crime and setting out the conditions under which the Court shall exercise jurisdiction with respect to this crime. Such a provision shall be consistent with the relevant provisions of the [[Charter of the United Nations]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://legal.un.org/icc/statute/99_corr/2.htm#art.5  Part 2. Jurisdiction, admissibility and applicable law.  Article 5.]&lt;/ref&gt; and additions of Article 8 bis and Article 15 bis/ter that defined the "crime of aggression" and conditions on the exercise of jurisdiction over the "crime of aggression," respectively.
* Resolution RC/Res.6 states that these amendments enter into force in accordance with Article 121.5 of the Rome Statute, meaning for each ratifying State individually one year after the deposit of its instrument of ratification or acceptance. For the Court to actively exercise jurisdiction over the crime of aggression, however, the amendments stipulate additional conditions: The amendments must have been ratified or accepted since a year by at least thirty States Parties, and in addition States Parties must “activate” the Court's jurisdiction through an additional decision to be taken on or after 1 January 2017 by a two thirds majority.

== Definition ==
Under the Statute, the definition of "crime of aggression" is stated as follows:

=== Article 8 bis ===

For the purpose of this Statute, “crime of aggression” means the planning, preparation, initiation or execution, by a person in a position effectively to exercise control over or to direct the political or military action of a State, of an act of aggression which, by its character, gravity and scale, constitutes a manifest violation of the Charter of the United Nations.
:2. For the purpose of paragraph 1, “act of aggression” means the use of [[armed force]] by a State against the [[sovereignty]], [[territorial integrity]] or [[political independence]] of another State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Charter of the United Nations. Any of the following acts, regardless of a [[declaration of war]], shall, in accordance with [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3314|United Nations General Assembly resolution 3314]] (XXIX) of 14 December 1974, qualify as an act of aggression:
::(a) The [[invasion]] or attack by the armed forces of a State of the [[territory (country subdivision)|territory]] of another State, or any [[military occupation]], however temporary, resulting from such invasion or attack, or any [[annexation]] by the [[use of force]] of the territory of another State or part thereof;
::(b) [[Bombardment]] by the armed forces of a State against the territory of another State or the use of any [[weapons]] by a State against the territory of another State;

::(f) The action of a State in allowing its territory, which it has placed at the disposal of another State, to be used by that other State for perpetrating an act of aggression against a third State;
::(g) The sending by or on behalf of a State of armed bands, groups, irregulars or [[mercenaries]], which carry out acts of armed force against another State of such gravity as to amount to the acts listed above, or its substantial involvement therein.

== Exercise of jurisdiction  ==
Under the Statute, the conditions for the exercise of jurisdiction for the "crime of aggression" by the Court are as defined below. With these provisions, the Court may exercise its jurisdiction over the "crime of aggression" in one or all of the following ways.
# State referral, ''[[proprio motu]]'' 
# Security Council referral

=== Article 15 bis ===
Exercise of jurisdiction over the crime of aggression (State referral, [[proprio motu]])
#The Court may exercise jurisdiction over the crime of aggression in accordance with article 13, paragraphs (a) and (c), subject to the provisions of this article.
#The Court may exercise jurisdiction only with respect to crimes of aggression committed one year after the [[ratification]] or [[acceptance]] of the amendments by thirty States Parties.
#The Court shall exercise jurisdiction over the crime of aggression in accordance with this article, subject to a decision to be taken after 1 January 2017 by the same majority of States Parties as is required for the adoption of an amendment to the Statute.
#The Court may, in accordance with article 12, exercise jurisdiction over a crime of aggression, arising from an act of aggression committed by a State Party, unless that State Party has previously declared that it does not accept such jurisdiction by lodging a declaration with the Registrar. The withdrawal of such a declaration may be effected at any time and shall be considered by the State Party within three years.
#In respect of a State that is not a party to this Statute, the Court shall not exercise its jurisdiction over the crime of aggression when committed by that State's nationals or on its territory.
#Where the [[Prosecutor]] concludes that there is a reasonable basis to proceed with an [[Criminal investigation|investigation]] in respect of a crime of aggression, he or she shall first ascertain whether the Security Council has made a determination of an act of aggression committed by the State concerned. The Prosecutor shall notify the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]] of the situation before the Court, including any relevant information and documents.
#Where the Security Council has made such a determination, the Prosecutor may proceed with the investigation in respect of a crime of aggression.
#Where no such determination is made within six months after the date of notification, the Prosecutor may proceed with the investigation in respect of a crime of aggression, provided that the Pre-Trial Division has authorized the commencement of the investigation in respect of a crime of aggression in accordance with the procedure contained in article 15, and the Security Council has not decided otherwise in accordance with article 16.
#A determination of an act of aggression by an organ outside the Court shall be without prejudice to the Court's own findings under this Statute.
#This article is without prejudice to the provisions relating to the exercise of jurisdiction with respect to other crimes referred to in article 5.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.icc-cpi.int/nr/rdonlyres/add16852-aee9-4757-abe7-9cdc7cf02886/283503/romestatuteng1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the amendments on the crime of aggression were adopted under Article 121.5, they enter into force for each ratifying State individually. In addition, the amendments require two further conditions to be fulfilled for the Court to exercise jurisdiction, both for state referrals and ''proprio motu'' investigations (15 bis) and for Security Council referrals (15 ter):
# The Court may exercise jurisdiction only with respect to crimes of aggression committed one year after the ratification or acceptance of the amendments by thirty States Parties.
# The Court shall exercise jurisdiction over the crime of aggression in accordance with this article, subject to a decision to be taken after 1 January 2017 by the same majority of States Parties as is required for the adoption of an amendment to the Statute.
At the 16th annual session of the Assembly of States Parties to the Rome Treaty, it was decided to activate jurisdiction of the Crime of Aggression starting July 17, 2018.&lt;ref name="ICC_CrimeAgression_20180717" /&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
In 2006, the [[House of Lords]] ruled in the case or ''R v Jones'' that the crime of aggression did not exist in English law as it applied within the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldjudgmt/jd060329/jones.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
After its formal participation in the Review Conference as Observer, on 15 June 2010 the [[United States]] government held a special briefing on the Conference outlining what they deemed as accomplishments.

{{Quotation|The United States considered the definition of aggression flawed, but a number of important safeguards were adopted. Understandings were adopted to make the definition more precise, to ensure that the crime will be applied only to the most egregious circumstances. And while we think the final resolution took insufficient account of the Security Council’s assigned role to define aggression, the states parties rejected solutions that provided for jurisdiction without a Security Council or consent-based screen. We hope that crime will be improved in the future and will continue to engage toward that end.|Harold Hongju Koh, Legal Advisor U.S. Department of State &lt;ref&gt;

{{History of the Republic of China}}
The '''1987 Lieyu massacre''', also known as the '''March 7 Incident''', '''Donggang Incident''' or '''Donggang Massacre''', occurred on 7 March 1987 at Donggang Bay, [[Lieyu, Fujian|Lieyu]] Island ("Lesser Kinmen" or "Little Quemoy"), [[Kinmen]], [[Fujian Province, Republic of China|Fujian]], [[Republic of China]]. According to the diary of [[Four-star rank|General]] [[Hau Pei-tsun]], nineteen unarmed [[Vietnamese boat people]] were killed by the [[Republic of China Armed Forces|ROC military]]. There may have been more than nineteen deaths.

==Background==
{{See also|Chinese Civil War|Taiwan Strait Crisis|Two Chinas|Martial law in Taiwan}}
The 1987 Lieyu massacre was preceded by an incident where a young couple from mainland China swam to [[Dadan Island]] (大膽島) seeking [[Right of asylum|asylum]]. At that time, all the islets of the Kinmen [[Archipelago]] were considered as war zones under [[Martial Law]], which was to allow the [[Republic of China (Taiwan)]] to prevent an attack by the [[People's Liberation Army]] of the [[Communist Party of China]]. The commanding [[major-general]] of the Dadan Defense Team, Premier deputy division commander of the 158 Lieyu [[Division (military)|Division]] (烈嶼師), received the couple and escorted them to the superior-level Kinmen Defense Command (金防部), but was immediately relieved of his post for violating the directive to "Accept no [[surrender (military)|surrender]] in the war zone".

As a result, the commanding [[lieutenant-colonel]] of the neighboring [[Erdan Island]], Deputy brigade commander of the 473 Brigade, summoned all the soldiers to reiterate the order that "Whoever lands on the island must be executed without exception". Soon after this, he was promoted to the position of 472 Nantang [[brigade commander]] (南塘旅), taking charge of all the units in the South [[Lieyu, Kinmen|Lieyu]] Defense Team.

At noon on 28 February 1987, one week before the Lieyu massacre, a local Chinese [[fishing boat]] crossed [[Xiamen Bay]]. It was intensely fired upon until it caught fire near [[Dadan Island]]. The [[fishermen]] on board waved a white cloth in an attempt to communicate their surrender. However, the boat was sunk by [[tank gun]] shots ordered by the new Dadan commander colonel, Secondary deputy division commander of the 158 Division, upon receiving the approval of the Kinmen Defense Command. There was only one survivor, who swam to cling onto a [[Rock (geology)|rock]] nearby, but who was eventually lost to the waves.

==Massacre==
On 7 March 1987, a boat carrying Vietnamese refugees arrived in [[Kinmen]] requesting [[political asylum]]. The request was rejected by the Kinmen Defense Command. The boat was towed away from the shore by a patrol boat of the [[Amphibious reconnaissance|Amphibious Reconnaissance]] [[Battalion]] (ARB-101, 海龍蛙兵) with a warning not to return. However, for reasons unclear, the information about the boat's presence in the Southern sea was never forwarded to the front line of the coastal defense units, including those in the [[Lieyu, Kinmen|Lieyu]] island.

At 16:37 in the afternoon of 7 March 1987, under heavy [[fog]], the Vietnamese boat was sighted off the shore of [[Lieyu, Kinmen|Lieyu]]. The 472 [[brigade]] commander and the local 1st Dashanding (大山頂) infantry [[battalion]] commander arrived at the scene with staff officers. Warning shots were fired by the [[Republic of China Armed Forces|ROC military]].  The Vietnamese boat stranded on the sand beach south-west of Donggang ("East Cape", Chinese: 東崗; Pinyin: Dōnggāng) Port (Fort 05), a sensitive strategic point between 2 forts with a blind angle on radar screen by the landform in front of the classified [[240 mm howitzer M1]] position of Kinmen Defense Command, and artillery battalions of 158 Division then. It was hit by [[crossfire]] and two [[bazooka]] shots by the WPN company in reinforcement. [[Armor-piercing shell]]s penetrated the wooden [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]] without [[explosion]]. Three unarmed Vietnamese men jumped off the boat, raised their hands, and said in Chinese, "Don't shoot..." but were all shot dead instantly.

The local 3rd Dongang [[Company (military unit)|company]] commander captain on site received an order from the brigade commander to lead a search team boarding the boat.  Two [[hand grenades]] were thrown into the boat. The commander then found that all the passengers were [[Vietnam]]ese refugees with no weapon. The passengers said the vessel had experienced a mechanical failure. Because of the heavy fog, the strong seasonal [[Ocean current|currents]] and the rising [[tide]] since late afternoon, the boat drifted into the bay. The surviving passengers and the bodies of the dead were taken out of the boat and placed on the beach with neither [[first aid]] nor any [[life support]] supply rendered. Followed by intense [[telecommunication]] with the division HQ, the commanders at the scene received orders from their superiors - alleged directly by General Zhao, Commander of the Kinmen Defense Command - to execute the passengers to eliminate all the eyewitnesses. Some received multiple shots when one bullet did not kill. Among the bodies piled were elderly, women, one [[pregnant]], children, and a baby in a [[sweater]].

In the morning 09:00 of 8 March 1987, the [[Medic]]al [[Platoon]] of the [[Headquarters and Headquarters Company|battalion HQ Company]] was called in to bury all the bodies at the beach. The platoon members were ordered to execute any surviving refugees. The wounded were buried alive, and those who were still moving or crying were dictated to be killed by military shovels. The entire boat was also instructed to be burned down aside from the only propeller non-flammable to gasoline, then all buried in sand to destroy all the evidence right away. The last victim, a little boy being hidden underneath a board cell was also executed by order without exception. The guarding [[sergeant]] of the battalion HQ company counted the bodies as more than nineteen.

Since some [[Combat Medic|medics]] defied the direct order of victim execution, the [[brigade commander]] instructed the Nantang [[Headquarters and Headquarters Company|brigade HQ Company]] commander captain to dispatch soldiers taking over the [[battalion]] HQ and the battalion HQ company as emergency measure.  Later that day, a real fishing boat from [[China]] approached the coast attempting to check out what happened. it was also shot to destroy, and sunk in the open sea with 4 confirmed kills to assure all lips sealed - which some veterans later called the "March 8 Incident".&lt;ref&gt;Ah-hsin, 158D veteran, "20th Memorial to the Donggang Incident", (阿信 [http://natac.pixnet.net/blog/post/99733293-%E6%9D%B1%E5%B4%97%E4%BA%8B%E4%BB%B6%E4%BA%8C%E5%8D%81%E9%80%B1%E5%B9%B4 《東崗事件二十週年》]，難得緣份～金誠連部落格), Mar. 7, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Ten weeks later, the [[President of the Republic of China]] (Taiwan), [[Chiang Ching-kuo]], reacted to concealment of the massacre by the 158 [[Division (military)|Division]] and the Kinmen Defense Command. Commander of the Kinmen Defense Command, [[General]] Zhao Wan-fu (Chinese: 趙萬富; Pinyin: Zhào Wànfù), said he was unaware of the event. While being questioned by the Chief of the General Staff, [[General]] [[Hau Pei-tsun]], Zhao Wan-fu lied, "It was just a couple of 'Communist soldiers' (referring to the penetration of [[People's Liberation Army]]) being shot in the water", but Zhao's statement was obviously unbelievable. Then [[General]] [[Hau Pei-tsun]] ordered the [[exhumation]] of the corpses from the first scene, moved them toward a higher hidden slope to the right, filled with [[cement]] and built a concrete wall above it to prevent any future investigation. The corpses remain sealed in the final place with no tomb today.

==Revelation==
The native store owner heard the crying of refugees overnight and made a phone call to inform the [[National Assembly (Republic of China)|National Assembly]] member, [[Huang Chao-hui]] in [[Kaohsiung]], but the contact was soon lost whereas all long-distance phone calls being routinely monitored by the communication supervision unit of Kinmen Defense Command. Nevertheless, the bodies were not buried deeply on the first scene. Influenced by tidal [[seawater]] and high temperatures, the bodies soon began to [[decompose]] and were dug out by [[wild dog]]s from the [[landfill]] on the back side of the western hill. Accounts of [[ghost]] sightings prompted villagers to hold religious ceremonies, making it all the more difficult to block the news.

In early May 1987, the [[British Hong Kong]] newspaper ''[[South China Morning Post]]'' first reported the massacre. Informed by the overseas office, higher officials questioned the Kinmen Defense Command but got no concrete response; instead, the Command swapped this coast defense [[battalion]] from the front line with another reserve battalion in the training base in urgency in order to strengthen the personnel control and communication restriction to prevent further leaking news, and their unit designation codes were also shifted for the 2 years to confuse outsiders. Twice of [[bribery|extra bonus]] cash summing up to half a month of a [[captain]]'s salary, $6000 were also abnormally awarded to the [[company commander]]s against the government ethics on the eve of [[Dragon boat festival]]. Until the end of May, recently discharged [[conscription|conscript]] soldiers from Kinmen began to arrive in Taiwan Proper by the term schedule and finally able to appeal to the newly founded [[opposition party]], [[Democratic Progressive Party]]. The information of the massacre started to spread in Taiwan.

As a key witness during the investigation in the late-May, the Chief Intelligence Officer of 158 Division, Lieutenant Colonel Lai Xu (徐萊), mysteriously disappeared after a supervision task over night patrol and checkpoints, same to another [[non-commissioned officer]] at post within a week. Their bodies were never found.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Xu, [http://medico.pixnet.net/blog/post/26952464-%E7%88%B6%E8%A6%AA(%E4%B8%8A)-%E9%87%91%E9%96%80%E5%B1%A0%E6%AE%BA%E4%BA%8B%E4%BB%B6] "My father in the Kinmen massacre" (徐霆《父親(上) 金門屠殺事件》), Jun. 4, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 June 1987, ''[[Independence Evening Post]]'' was the first Taiwanese newspaper reporting the massacre with the formal questioning by the newly elected [[Parliament Member]] [[Wu Shu-chen]] from the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] to the [[Ministry of National Defense (Republic of China)|Ministry of National Defense]] during the general assembly of [[Legislative Yuan]].  Her questions were repeatedly denied by the Military Spokesman, [[Major-general]] Zhang Hui Yuan, who accused Wu of "sabotaging the national reputation", and claimed it was actually "a Chinese [[fishing boat]] being sunk in the sea after ignoring the warnings".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | script-title=zh:大陸民主鬥士，非請莫入 | author=文現深 | url=http://store.gvm.com.tw/magazine_information_38.html |journal=Global Views Monthly《遠見雜誌》| issue=Vol.38 }} Aug. 1989&lt;/ref&gt; The case has been classified as military secret ever since for 20 years to prevent any further leaking information or the prosecution will apply.&lt;ref&gt;Yung-yuan, [http://home.gamer.com.tw/creationDetail.php?sn=3018241 "Related reportage entries on March 7 Incident"]《三七事件相關報導》clipping data, Bahamut, Nov. 15, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The following media reports were censored and the publication were banned by the Nationalist government. Eventually when the police broke into the ''Freedom Era Weekly'' magazine office for arrest with another count of [[Treason]] charge in April, 1989, [[Editor-in-chief]], [[Cheng Nan-jung]] [[Self-immolation|set himself on fire]] then died in blaze to protest for the [[freedom of speech]].  Journalist Zhang Youhua (張友驊) of ''Independence Evening Post'' on the other hand was sentenced to 1 year and 7 months with a probation period of 3 years in November 1991.

The official [[cover-up]] story of the Chinese fishing boat sunk by one shell of bombardment applied to the public for 13 years, until being uncovered by the publication of «''Diary of the Chief of the General Staff (1981-1989)''» by General Hau in 2000. The [[Government of the Republic of China]] has made [[no comment]] thereafter.

==Aftermath==
After the scandal was exposed, President [[Chiang Ching-kuo]] received a letter from [[Amnesty International]] expressing [[Humanitarianism|humanitarian]] concern, and assigned the Chief of General Staff, General Hau, to investigate this case. A special envoy of the [[Political Warfare Bureau]] was dispatched to Kinmen and found the case true.  All the commanders and the corresponding political officers along the chain of command, including [[Kinmen]] Defense Command, 158 [[Lieyu, Kinmen|Lieyu]] [[Division (military)|Division]], 472 Nantang [[Brigade]], the 1st Dashanding [[Battalion]], the HQ, WPN and 3rd Donggang companies were detained and brought back to [[Taipei]], then only the division officers were charged in [[court martial]] in October, 1987.

Brigade Commander Zhong was sentenced to 1 year and 10 months for abetting murder; Battalion Commander Major Liu was sentenced to 1 year and 10 months for being an accomplice to murder; WPN and 3rd Company commanders, Captain Li and Captain Zhang, both were sentenced to 1 year and 8 months for murder - but all the sentences were commuted with a [[probation]] period of 3 years, therefore none of the convicted field commanders was required to spend a day in jail until later under heavy pressure from the international society and media. Their later regular [[retirement]] and [[pension]] plans were not affected.

The superior officers received no official punishment, and recovered their military career after President Chiang suddenly died in January, 1988. [[Brigade commander|Brigade Commander]] Zhong took a senior lead [[colonel]] position in a [[military academy]] (陸軍通校); [[Division (military)|Division]] Commander Gong shifted to the Chief of Staff of the War College, [[National Defense University (Republic of China)|National Defense University]], before being promoted to the Deputy Commander of the Hua-Tung Defense Command (花東防衛司令部) in 1991; Kinmen Defense Commander Zhao was promoted to Deputy Chief Commander [[Republic of China Army rank insignia|General]] of the [[Republic of China Army]] in 1989, and further to Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the [[Republic of China Armed Forces]] in 1991; then appointed with honours as a strategy advisor (戰略顧問) to the [[President of the Republic of China]] in 2 terms, and then the permanent title as the reviewer member (中評委) of the [[Central Committee]] of the [[ruling party]], [[Kuomintang]] ([[Chinese Nationalist Party]]) till his death on Feb. 28, 2016. His official funeral was proceeded with his coffin covered by the [[Flag of the Republic of China|National Flag]], the [[military salute]] of the top-ranked generals, and [[Vice-president]] [[Wu Den-yih]] presenting the Commendation Decree of [[President (government title)|President]] [[Ma Ying-jeou]], who praises Zhao's 50-year career in [[national security]] with so-called "[[loyalty]], [[diligence]], [[bravery]], [[Persistence (psychology)|perseverance]], [[intelligence]], [[wisdom]], [[insight]] and [[Effectiveness|proficiency]]" (忠勤勇毅，才識閎通), whereas "his [[virtue]] and [[Behavior|conducts]] have set a good example [[Role model|model]] for future generation to follow...."

The '''Kfar Etzion massacre''' refers to a massacre of Jews that took place after a two-day battle in which Jewish [[Kibbutz]] residents and [[Haganah]] militia defended [[Kfar Etzion]] from a combined force of the [[Arab Legion]] and local Arab men on May 13, 1948,  the day before the [[Declaration of Independence (Israel)|Israeli Declaration of Independence]].
Of the 129 Haganah fighters and Jewish kibbutzniks who died during the defence of the settlement, [[Martin Gilbert]] states that fifteen were murdered on surrendering.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Gilbert]], ''Jerusalem - Illustrated History Atlas,'', V. Mitchell 1994, page 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

Controversy surrounds the responsibility and role of the Arab Legion in the killing of those who surrendered. The official Israeli version maintains that the kibbutz residents and Haganah soldiers were massacred by local Arabs and the Arab Legion of the Jordanian Army as they were surrendering. The Arab Legion version maintains that the Legion arrived too late to prevent the  attack on the kibbutz by men from nearby Arab villages, which was allegedly motivated by a desire to revenge the [[massacre of Deir Yassin]], and the destruction of one of their villages several months earlier.&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry Laurens (scholar)|Henry Laurens]], ''La Question de Palestine,'' vol.2, Fayard 2007 p.96.:'According to the Arab Legion version, the Jordanian soldiers arrived too late to impede the massacre by villagers who were keen to avenge Deir Yassin and the losses they had sustained since November (it should be kept in mind that it was the colony that opened hostilities in December by destroying a nearby village)'. Selon la version de la Légion, les soldats jordaniens sont arrivés trop tard pour empêcher le massacre de la part des villageois désireux de venger Deir Yassin et leurs pertes depuis le mois de novembre (il faut rappeler que c'est la colonie qui a ouvert les hostilités en décembre en détruisant un village voisin).'  Laurens adds:'Le plus probable est que tout se soit passé dans la plus grande confusion' (Most probably, everything took place in a situation of enormous confusion.)&lt;/ref&gt; The surrendering Jewish residents and fighters are said to have been assembled in a courtyard, only to be suddenly fired upon; it is said that many died on the spot, while most of those who managed to flee were hunted down and killed.&lt;ref name="Benvenisti"/&gt;

Four prisoners survived the massacre and were transferred to Transjordan.&lt;ref name="Benvenisti"&gt;[[Meron Benvenisti]],[https://archive.org/details/sacredlandscapeb00benvrich/page/116 "Sacred Landscape: The Buried History of the Holy Land since 1948''], University of California Press,  2000 p.116&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately following the surrender on May 13, the kibbutz was looted and razed to the ground.&lt;ref name="Benvenisti"/&gt; The members of the three other kibbutzim of the Gush Etzion surrendered the next day and were taken as [[Prisoner of war|POWs]] to Jordan.

The bodies of the victims were left unburied until, one and a half years later, the Jordanian government allowed [[Shlomo Goren]] to collect the remains, which were then interred at [[Mount Herzl]]. The survivors of the Etzion Bloc were housed in former Arab houses in [[Jaffa]].&lt;ref name="Occupied Territories p.20"&gt;[[Gershom Gorenberg]], ''Occupied Territories: The Untold Story of Israel's Settlements,''I.B.Tauris, 2007 p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[Kfar Etzion]] was a [[kibbutz]] founded in 1943, for military and agricultural ends,&lt;ref name="Collins-Lapierre 215-130" &gt;[[Larry Collins (writer)|Larry Collins]], [[Dominique Lapierre]], ''O Jerusalem,''(1972) Granada Books 1982, p. 217&lt;/ref&gt; about 2&amp;nbsp;km west of [[Highway 60 (Israel–Palestine)|the road]] between [[Jerusalem]] and [[Hebron]]. By the end of 1947, there were 163 adults and 50 children living there. Together with three nearby kibbutzim established 1945-1947, it formed ''[[Gush Etzion]]'' (''the Etzion Bloc''). According to one member of the settlement, relations were good between settlers and local Arabs, with attendance at each other's weddings, until November 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Margalit Zisman, cited Michael Petrou, ''Is This Your First War?: Travels Through the Post-9/11 Islamic World'', Dundurn, 2012 p. 167&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alvaia gush ezion.jpg|thumb|250px|Funeral procession leaving from [[Jewish Agency]] building, [[Jerusalem]]]]
The [[1947 UN Partition Plan|United Nations partition plan for Palestine]] of November 29, 1947 placed the bloc, an enclave in a purely Arab area, inside the boundaries of the intended Arab state,&lt;ref&gt;Avi Shlaim, 'Israel and the Arab Coalition in 1948,' in Albert H. Hourani,Phillip Khoury,Mary Christina Wilson (eds.)''The Modern Middle East,'' I.B.Tauris, 2nd ed. (2005), pp. 535-56.&lt;/ref&gt; where, moreover, Jewish settlement was to be forbidden through a transitional period.&lt;ref&gt;Benny Morris, ''The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem Revisited, ''Cambridge University Press, 2004, p. 370.&lt;/ref&gt; For Hebronite Arabs, the bloc constituted an 'alien intrusion' on ground that had been wholly Arab for centuries,' though it had been built on land either purchased by Jews (1928) or acquired by them through a complex circumvention of Mandatory law in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;[[Larry Collins (writer)|Larry Collins]], [[Dominique Lapierre]], ''O Jerusalem,''(1972) Granada Books 1982 p.216.'In 1942, by a complex legal manoeuvre, the Fund circumvented the restrictions on Jewish land purchases set out by the British government's 1939 White Paper and acquired the land of a nearby German monastery whose monks had been interned as enemy aliens by the British. On an April night one year later, three women and ten men slipped through the darkness to lay claim to the monastery and officially establish the settlement of Kfar Etzion.'&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Henry Laurens (scholar)|Henry Laurens]], Kfar Etzion had started hostilities in the area in December by destroying a local Arab village.&lt;ref name="Palestine, p.96"&gt;[[Henry Laurens (scholar)]], ''La Question de Palestine,'' vol.2, Fayard 2007 p.96.&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 December, a convoy from Bethlehem en route to the Gush Etzion bloc was ambushed and 10 of its 26 passengers and escorts were killed.&lt;ref name="Collins-Lapierre 215-130"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yoav Gelber,''Palestine, 1948: War, Escape and the Emergence of the Palestinian Refugee Problem,''Sussex University Press p.26.&lt;/ref&gt;  Though on January 5, the children and some women had been evacuated with British assistance, and though [[David Shaltiel]] recommended its evacuation,&lt;ref name="Collins-Lapierre 215-130"/&gt; the [[Haganah]], on [[Yigal Yadin]]'s counsel, decided against withdrawing from the settlements for several reasons: they commanded a strategic position on [[Highway 60 (Israel–Palestine)|Jerusalem's southern approach from Hebron]],&lt;ref name="encyc"&gt;Mark Daryl Erickson, Joseph E. Goldberg, Stephen H. Gotowicki, Bernard Reich, Sanford R. Silverburg (1996). ''An Historical Encyclopedia of the Arab-Israeli Conflict'', p. 149. Greenwood; {{ISBN|0-313-27374-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were considered, in the words of [[Abdullah el-Tell|Abdullah Tall]], a 'sharp thorn stuck in the heart of a purely Arab area'. Several relief convoys from the [[Haganah]] in Jerusalem [[Gush Etzion Convoy|had been ambushed]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

In the months prior to May 15, Haganah militiamen in the bloc's kibbutzim repeatedly fired on Arab civilians, and British traffic, including convoys, moving between Jerusalem and Hebron, under instruction to do so in order to draw and drain Arab forces from the fight for Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Laurens, ''La Question de Palestine,'' Fayard 2007, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Benny Morris pp.135-7"&gt;Benny Morris, ''The Road to Jerusalem: Glubb Pasha, Palestine and the Jews,'' I.B.Tauris, 2003, pp. 135-37.&lt;/ref&gt; On two occasions, April 12 and May 3, Arab Legion units were ambushed, and several legionnaires killed or wounded&lt;ref name="Benny Morris pp.135-7"/&gt; by the bloc militias, - Kfar Etzion soldiers being directly involved in the incident on April 12&lt;ref&gt;''Chronology of International Events and Documents,'' Volume 4 
Royal Institute of International Affairs, 1947 p.270:'12 April. — Jews in the Kfar Etzion settlement near the Jerusalem-Tel Aviv road fired on an Arab convoy and the Arabs fought back.'&lt;/ref&gt; - Arab [[Irregular military|irregular forces]] made small-scale attacks against the settlements. An emergency [[Convoy of 35|reinforcement convoy]] attempting to march to Gush Etzion under cover of darkness was discovered and its members killed by Palestinian Arab forces.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} Despite some emergency flights by an [[Auster]] from Jerusalem&lt;ref name="Collins-Lapierre 215-130"/&gt; and [[Piper J-3|Piper Cubs]] out of [[Tel Aviv]] onto an improvised airfield,&lt;ref name="Occupied Territories p.20"/&gt;  adequate supplies were not getting in.

As the end of the [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|British Mandate]] drew closer, the fighting in the region intensified. Although the [[Arab Legion]] was theoretically in Palestine under British command, they began to operate more and more independently. On March 27, land communication with the [[Yishuv|rest of the Yishuv]] was severed completely when the [[Gush Etzion Convoy|Nebi Daniel Convoy]] was ambushed on its return to Jerusalem, and 15 Haganah soldiers died before the remainder were extricated by the British. It was ambushes by the Etzion Bloc militias conducted against Arab Legion units on April 12 and May 4 that, according to a Hanagah analysis, tipped the Legion's policy towards the bloc from one of isolating it to destroying it.&lt;ref&gt;Benny Morris,''The Road to Jerusalem,'' p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; On May 4, following the last ambush of a Legion convoy, a joint force of British, Arab Legion and irregular troops launched a major punitive attack on Kfar Etzion. The Haganah abandoned a few outposts but generally resisted, and the attack failed, leaving 12 Haganah soldiers dead, 30 wounded, with a similar number of Arab legionnaires killed, and several dozen wounded. Units from the bloc may have attacked Arab traffic the following day, but the failure of the Legion's assault led Hebronites and Legion units to plan a final attack and destroy the Etzion Bloc militarily.&lt;ref&gt;Benny Morris,''The Road to Jerusalem,'' pp. 137-38.&lt;/ref&gt;
The final assault on Kfar Etzion began on May 12. Parts of two Arab Legion companies, assisted by hundreds of local [[Irregular military|irregulars]], had a dozen [[Armored car (military)|armored car]]s and artillery, to which the Jewish defenders had no effective answer. The commander of Kfar Etzion requested from the Central Command in Jerusalem permission to evacuate the kibbutz, but was ordered to stay. Later in the day, the Arabs captured the [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]] [[monastery]], which the Haganah used as a perimeter fortress for the Kfar Etzion area, killing twenty-four of its thirty-two defenders.

On May 13, an attack broke through Kfar Etzion's defences and reached the settlement's centre effectively cutting off the perimeter outposts from each other.&lt;ref name="morris"&gt;B.

==The massacre==

In the Israeli mainstream version, when the hopelessness of their position became undeniable on May 13, dozens of defenders, the ''haverim'', of Kfar Etzion laid down their arms and assembled in the courtyard, where they suddenly began to be shot at. Those not slain in the first volleys of fire pushed past the Arabs, and either escaped to hide, or gathered their weapons,&lt;ref&gt;Dov Knohl,''Siege in the Hills:: The Battle of the Etzion Bloc,'' T. Yoseloff, 1958, p. 334.&lt;/ref&gt; and were hunted down.&lt;ref&gt;Benny Morris, ''The Road to Jerusalem: Glubb Pasha, Palestine and the Jews,''pp. 138-39&lt;/ref&gt; The number of people killed and the perpetrators, the Arab legion or local village irregulars or both, are in dispute. According to one account, the main group of about 50 defenders were surrounded by a large number of Arab irregulars, who shouted "[[Deir Yassin massacre|Deir Yassin!]]" and ordered the Jews to sit down, stand up, and sit down again, when suddenly someone opened fire on the Jews with a machine gun and others joined in the killing. Those Jews not immediately cut down tried to run away but were pursued. According to Meron Benvenisti, hand grenades were thrown into a cellar, killing a group of 50 who were hiding there. The building was blown up.&lt;ref name="Benvenisti"/&gt;

According to other sources, 20 women hiding in a cellar were killed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ruth Gruber]] ,''Israel on the seventh day,'' Hill and Wang, 1968 p.30.'Twenty women who had hidden in a cellar were massacred by Arabs with hand grenades.'&lt;/ref&gt; David Ohana writes that 127 Israeli fighters were killed on the last day.&lt;ref&gt;David Ohana, ''The Origins of Israeli Mythology: Neither Canaanites Nor Crusaders,'' Cambridge University Press, 2012, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Arab losses during the two day battle, according to a Haganah estimate, numbered 69: 42 irregulars, and 27 legionnaires.&lt;ref&gt;Benny Morris, ibid. p269 n.398.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of Israeli histories of the Kfar Etzion massacre (such as Levi, 1986, Isseroff, 2005) state that the defenders had put out the [[white flag]] and lined up to surrender in front of the school building of the German monastery. An Arab version recounts that a white flag was flown, and drew the Arabs into a trap where they were fired on.&lt;ref name="Palestine, p.96"/&gt; Benny Morris cites a Legion officer's statement that the defenders had not formally surrendered, that some resistance continued, with shooting at Arabs, after others had surrendered, that local villagers shot legionnaires trying to defend prisoners, and that legionnaires had to shoot some villagers engaged in the killings.&lt;ref&gt;Benny Morris, ''The Road to Jerusalem: Glubb Pasha, Palestine and the Jews,'' p.139.&lt;/ref&gt; The figure of 127 massacred appears to include both those who surrendered only to be slain, and the defenders who had been killed in battle over 12–13 May.&lt;ref&gt;Benny Morris, ibid. p269 n.398.&lt;/ref&gt;

In another account, after the 133 defenders had assembled, they were photographed by a man in a [[kaffiyeh]], and then an armored car apparently belonging to the [[Arab Legion]] opened fire with its machine gun, and then Arab irregulars joined in. A group of defenders managed to crawl into the cellar of the monastery, where they defended themselves until a large number of grenades were thrown into the cellar. The building was then blown up and collapsed on them. About 129 persons died in the battle and its aftermath.  Only three of the remaining Kfar Etzion residents and one [[Palmach]] member survived. According to their own testimony, the circumstances of their survival were as follows.
* Yaacov Edelstein and Yitzhak Ben-Sira tried to hide amongst a jumble of boulders and branches, but they were discovered by a "wrinkled, toothless, old Arab" who told them "Don't be afraid." Then a group of Arab irregulars rushed up and threw them against a wall. The old Arab tried to shield them with his body. As they argued, two Arab Legionnaires came up and took the two Jews under their protection.
* Nahum Ben-Sira, the brother of Yitzhak, was away from the main group when the massacre started. He hid until nightfall then escaped to a nearby kibbutz.
* Alisa Feuchtwanger (Palmach) tried to hide in a ditch with several others. They were discovered and all were murdered except Alisa, who was dragged away by several Arab irregulars. As the group were trying to rape her, an Arab Legion officer (Captain Hikmat Mihyar) arrived, shot two of the perpetrators and sent the rest away. Afterwards the officer gave her bread, waited until she finished eating, and said to her (quote) "You are under my protection". She testified that while the officer took her to safety, he shot dead wounded Jews.&lt;ref name="Morris2003p139"&gt;{{cite book|author=Benny Morris|title=The Road to Jerusalem: Glubb Pasha, Palestine and the Jews|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zL_1icJwNP0C|date=3 October 2003|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-1-86064-989-9|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Alisaa and Nahum said that the Legion soldiers actively participated in the Massacre.&lt;ref name="Morris2003p139"/&gt;

[[File:HaBunker IMG 7921.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Names of fallen in Kfar Etzion Memorial]]
A total of 157 defenders died in the battle of [[Gush Etzion]] (Levi, 1986), including those killed in the massacre at Kfar Etzion. About 2/3 of them were residents and the remainder were Hagana or Palmach soldiers.

On the following day, the Arab irregular forces continued their assault on the remaining three Etzion settlements. Fearing that the defenders might suffer the same fate as those of Kfar Etzion, [[Zionist]] leaders in Jerusalem negotiated a deal for the surrender of the settlements on condition that the Arab Legion protected the residents. The [[Red Cross]] took the wounded to Jerusalem, and the Arab Legion took the remainder as prisoners of war. In March 1949 320 prisoners from the Etzion settlements were released from the "Jordan POW camp at [[Mafraq|Mafrak]]", including 85 women.&lt;ref&gt;Moshe Dayan, 'The Story of My Life'. {{ISBN|0-688-03076-9}}. Page 130. Out of a total of 670 prisoners released.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
{{refimprove section|date=May 2018}}
On October 28, 1948, the Arab village [[al-Dawayima]] was conquered by the IDF 89th Commando Battalion. The [[Al-Dawayima massacre]] then took place, as the villagers were blamed for the Kfar Etzion massacre. Estimates of the number of murdered Arab villagers range from 80–100 to 100–200, depending on the source.&lt;ref name = "Morris_2008"&gt;[[Benny Morris]] (2008), ''1948: An History the First Arab-Israeli War'', p. 333&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Saleh Abdel Jawad]] (2007), ''Zionist Massacres: the Creation of the Palestinian Refugee Problem in the 1948 War'', in E. Benvenisti &amp; al, ''Israel and the Palestinian Refugees'', Berlin, Heidelberg, New-York : Springer, pp. 59-127&lt;/ref&gt;

The bodies of the murdered of Kfar Etzion were left at the site for a year and a half, until in November 1949, the Chief Military Rabbi, [[Shlomo Goren]] was allowed to collect their bones. They were buried in a full military funeral on November 17 in [[Mount Herzl]] in Jerusalem. Their communal grave was the first grave in what is today the military cemetery of Mount Herzl.

The Etzion Bloc became a symbol of Zionist heroism and martyrdom among Israelis immediately after its fall, and this importance continues. The date of the massacre was enshrined as Israel's Day of Remembrance.

The site of the Etzion Bloc was recaptured by Israel during the [[Six-Day War|1967 war]]. The children who had been evacuated from the Bloc in 1948 led a public campaign for the Bloc to be resettled, and Prime Minister [[Levi Eshkol]] gave his approval. Kfar Etzion was re-established as a kibbutz in September 1967, as the first [[Israeli settlement]] in the [[West Bank]] after the war.

{{History of war}}

This article lists and summarizes the [[war crime]]s committed since the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907]] and the [[crimes against humanity]] and [[crimes against peace]] that have been committed since these crimes were first defined in the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Rome Statute]].{{efn|This list is a work in progress and is not complete.}}

Since many war crimes are not ultimately prosecuted (due to lack of political will, lack of effective procedures, or other practical and political reasons&lt;ref&gt;Comment by ''[[The Times]]'', November 21, 2006 p. 17, in relation to [[Jean-Pierre Bemba]] of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]]: "There was nothing funny about his soldiers' actions in Eastern Congo... Among the crimes alleged are mass murder, rape and acts of cannibalism. Yet one senior UN diplomat has indicated privately that for the sake of peace, the investigation [by the [[International Criminal Court]]] into Bemba's responsibility may be sidelined. It isn't just in Congo that trade-offs are being made. [...] Skeptics point out that those who have stood trial so far have either been defeated in war or are retired and irrelevant. They insist there would be no chance of hauling powerful political figures in Washington and London before a court to answer for their actions..."&lt;/ref&gt;), historians and lawyers will often make a serious case that war crimes occurred, even if there was no formal investigations or prosecution of the alleged crimes or an investigation cleared the alleged perpetrators.

War crimes under [[international law]] were firmly established by international trials such as the [[Nuremberg Trials]] and the [[Tokyo Trials]], in which Austrian, German and Japanese leaders were prosecuted for war crimes committed during [[World War II]].

[[File:LizzieVanZyl.jpg|thumb|right|[[Lizzie van Zyl]], a Boer child in a British [[concentration camp]]]]
The term "[[concentration camp]]" was used to describe camps operated by the [[British Empire]] in [[South Africa]] during the [[Second Boer War]] in the years 1900–1902. As [[Boer]] farms were destroyed by the British under their "[[Scorched Earth]]" policy, many tens of thousands of women and children were forcibly moved into the concentration camps. Over 26,000 Boer women and children were to perish in these concentration camps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |ref=harv |last=Wessels |first=André |date=2010|title=A Century of Postgraduate Anglo-Boer War (1899–1902) Studies: Masters' and Doctoral Studies Completed at Universities in South Africa, in English-speaking Countries and on the European Continent, 1908–2008 |publisher=African Sun Media |isbn=978-1-920383-09-1 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=b8gKAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA32 32]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1901, the Manila correspondent of the ''[[Public Ledger (Philadelphia)|Philadelphia Ledger]]'' wrote: "The present war is no bloodless, opera bouffe engagement; our men have been relentless, have killed to exterminate men, women, children, prisoners and captives, active insurgents and suspected people from lads of ten up, the idea prevailing that the Filipino as such was little better than a dog..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zinn|first=Howard|authorlink=Howard Zinn|title=[[A People's History of the United States]]|publisher=The New Press|location=New York City|year=2003|isbn=978-1-56584-826-9|ref=harv|page=230}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the [[Balangiga massacre]], which wiped out a U.S. company garrisoning [[Samar (province)|Samar]] town, U.S. Brigadier General [[Jacob H.

== 1914–1918: World War I ==
[[World War I]] was the first major international conflict to take place following the codification of war crimes at the [[Hague Convention of 1907]], including derived war crimes, such as the use of poisons as weapons, as well as crimes against humanity, and derivative crimes against humanity, such as torture, and genocide. Before, the [[Second Boer War]] took place after the [[Hague Convention of 1899]]. The Second Boer War (1899 until 1902) is known for the first concentration camps (1900 until 1902) for civilians in the 20th century.

==1939–1945: World War II==
{{TopicTOC-World War II}}
{{WWII timeline}}

===Axis powers===
The [[Axis Powers]] (Germany, Italy, and Japan) were some of the most systematic perpetrators of war crimes in modern history. Contributing factors included [[Nazi]] race theory, a desire for "living space" that justified the eradication of native populations, and militaristic indoctrination that encouraged the terrorization of conquered peoples and [[prisoners of war]]. The [[Holocaust]], the German attack on the Soviet Union and occupation of much of Europe, the Japanese occupation of [[Manchuria]] and the Philippines and attack on China all contributed to well over half of the civilian deaths in World War II and the conflicts that led up to the war. Even before post-war revelations of atrocities, Axis militaries were notorious for their brutal treatment of captured combatants.

====Crimes perpetrated by Germany====
{{Further|Nazi Germany|German war crimes#World War II|Consequences of Nazism}}
According to the [[International Military Tribunal|Nuremberg Trials]], there were four major war crimes that were alleged against German military (and Waffen-SS and NSDAP) men and officers, each with individual events that made up the major charges.

'''1. Participation in a common plan of [[conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] for the accomplishment of [[crimes against peace]]'''

'''2. Planning, initiating and waging wars of aggression and other crimes against peace'''
* Planning and executing a campaign of invasion of its European neighbors, as well as the conspiracy to violate the [[Treaty of Versailles]] and the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain]] through the [[remilitarization of the Rhineland]], and the annexations of [[Anschluss|Austria]] and [[Munich Crisis|Czechoslovakia]].

'''3. War Crimes'''
Atrocities against enemy combatants or conventional crimes committed by military units (see [[War crimes of the Wehrmacht]]), and include:
* [[Invasion of Poland]]: During the period of 1 September – 25 October 1939 German forces in their military actions engaged in executions of Polish POWs, bombing hospitals, murdering civilians, shooting refugees, and executing wounded soldiers. The cautious estimates give a number of at least 16,000 murdered victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipn.gov.pl/a_130804_wehrmacht_wyst.html |title=Otwarcie wystawy „»Z największą brutalnością...«.

* [[Pacification Operations in German occupied Poland]]: During the occupation of Poland by German Reich, Wehrmacht forces took part in several pacification actions in rural areas, that resulted in murder of at least 20,000 Polish villagers.
* [[Le Paradis massacre]]: In May 1940, British soldiers of the [[Royal Norfolk Regiment]] were captured by the SS and subsequently murdered. [[Fritz Knoechlein]] was tried found guilty and hanged.
* [[Wormhoudt massacre]]: In May 1940, British and French soldiers were captured by the SS and subsequently murdered. No one found guilty of the crime.
* [http://webarchive.bac-lac.gc.ca:8080/wayback/20061121103511/http://www.vac-acc.gc.ca/remembers/sub.cfm?source=memorials/ww2mem/ardenne d'Ardenne Massacres]: In June 1944 Canadian soldiers were captured by the SS and murdered by the [[12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend]]. SS General [[Kurt Meyer (Panzermeyer)]] was sentenced to be shot 1946. His sentence was commuted and he was released in 1954.
* [[Malmedy massacre]]: In December 1944, United States POWs captured by ''[[Kampfgruppe Peiper]]'' were murdered outside [[Malmedy]], Belgium.[[File:Announcement_of_death_of_150_of_Polish_hostages_executed_by_Nazi-German_occupants_in_Warsaw_(May_1944).jpg|thumb|Announcement of execution of 150 Polish hostages as revenge for assassination of 6 Germans, Warsaw, [[Nazi crimes against the Polish nation|Nazi-occupied Poland]], May 1944]]
* [[Gardelegen (war crime)]]: The German SS forced 1,016 slave laborers who were part of a transport evacuated from the [[Mittelbau-Dora|Dora]] labor sub-camp into a large barn which was then lit on fire. Most of the prisoners were burned alive; some were shot trying to escape.
* [[Marzabotto massacre]]: The German SS killing of at least 770 civilians of Marzabotto as a collective punishment for their support of Italian partisans and the [[Italian resistance movement]]
* [[Sant'Anna di Stazzema massacre]]: A massacre was committed in the hill village of Sant'Anna di Stazzema in Tuscany, Italy, in the course of an operation against the Italian resistance movement during the Italian Campaign of World War II.  560 local villagers and refugees were murdered and their bodies burnt in a scorched earth policy action by the Nazis.
* [[Massacre of the Acqui Division|Cefalonia Massacre]]: The mass execution of the men of the Italian 33rd Acqui Infantry Division by the Germans on the island of Cephalonia, Greece was committed after the [[Italian armistice]].
* [[Oradour-sur-Glane massacre]]: On 10 June 1944, the village of Oradour-sur-Glane in Haute-Vienne in then Nazi occupied France was destroyed.  642 of its inhabitants, including women and children, were massacred by a Waffen-SS company.
* The annihilation of the Czech city of [[Lidice]] was committed as an act of vengeance for the assassination of [[Reinhard Heydrich]].
* [[Massacre of Kalavryta]]: The extermination of the male population and the total destruction of the town of Kalavryta, in Greece, by German occupying forces during World War II, was committed on 13 December 1943.
* [[Distomo massacre]]: This attack was perpetrated by members of the Waffen-SS in the village of Distomo, Greece, during the Axis occupation of Greece during World War II.
* [[Kragujevac massacre]]:  This was a [[nazi war crime]] in which [[Serbs]], [[Jews]] and [[Romani people|Roma]] men and boys in [[Kragujevac]], [[Serbia (1941–1944)|Serbia]], were murdered by [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[Wehrmacht]] soldiers on 20 and 21 October 1941.
* The suppression of the 1944 [[Warsaw Uprising]] and [[Planned destruction of Warsaw|subsequent leveling of the whole city]] was a war crime. [[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 192-208, KZ Mauthausen, Sowjetische Kriegsgefangene.jpg|thumb|Naked [[German mistreatment of Soviet prisoners of war|Soviet prisoners of war]] in Mauthausen concentration camp. Unknown date]]
* The treatment of Soviet POWs throughout the war, who were not given the protections and guarantees of the [[Geneva Convention]] unlike other Allied prisoners was a war crime. [[Nazi crimes against Soviet POWs]], resulted in some 3.3 million to 3.5 million deaths.  This accounts for about 60% of all Soviet           [[POW|POWs.]]&lt;ref&gt;Christian Streit: Keine Kameraden: Die Wehrmacht und die Sowjetischen Kriegsgefangenen, 1941–1945, Bonn: Dietz (3. Aufl., 1. Aufl. 1978), {{ISBN|3-8012-5016-4}} – "Between 22 June 1941 and the end of the war, roughly 5.7 million members of the Red Army fell into German hands. In January 1945, 930,000 were still in German camps. A million at most had been released, most of whom were so-called "volunteers" (Hilfswillige) for (often compulsory) auxiliary service in the Wehrmacht. Another 500,000, as estimated by the Army High Command, had either fled or been liberated. The remaining 3,300,000 (57.5 percent of the total) had perished."&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Unrestricted submarine warfare]] against merchant shipping was another war crime.
* [[Commando Order]] which stated that Allied combatants encountered during [[commando]] operations were to be executed immediately upon capture and without trial, even if they were properly uniformed, unarmed, or intending to surrender was a war crime.
* [[Commissar Order]]:  An order stating that [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] political commissars found among captured troops were to be executed immediately was a war crime.
* [[Vinkt Massacre]]: In May 1940 at least 86 civilians in Vinkt were killed by the German [[Wehrmacht]].
* [[Heusden]]: A town hall was massacred in November 1944.
* [[German war crimes during the Battle of Moscow]] are another example.

'''4. Crimes against Humanity'''
Crimes committed well away from the lines of battle and unconnected in any way to military activity, distinct from war crimes
* The major crime was the [[Holocaust]], including:
** The construction and use of ''[[Extermination camp|Vernichtungslagern]]'' (extermination camps) to commit genocide, most prominently at [[Auschwitz]], [[Treblinka]], [[Majdanek]], [[Bełżec extermination camp|Bełżec]], [[Sobibor extermination camp|Sobibór]], and [[Chełmno extermination camp|Chełmno]]
*** The employment of other concentration camps across Europe, including [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]], [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp|Sachsenhausen]], [[Mauthausen]] and [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp|Bergen-Belsen]], which held Soviet POWs and political prisoners in inhuman conditions, and transported Jews and Roma to extermination camps
** [[Death marches (Holocaust)|Death marches]] of prisoners, particularly in the last months of the war when the aforementioned camps were being overrun by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]
** The widespread use of [[slavery|slave labor]] and forced/unfree labor by the Nazi regime, including the use of [[concentration camp]] and [[extermination camp]] prisoners as slaves, often with the intent of [[extermination through labor]] [[File:Einsatzgruppe shooting.jpg|thumb|German police shooting women and children from the [[Mizocz Ghetto]], 14 October 1942]]
** The establishment of Jewish [[Ghetto]]s in Eastern Europe intended to isolate Jewish communities for deportation and subsequent extermination
** The use of [[SS]] [[Einsatzgruppen]], mobile extermination squads, to exterminate Jews and anti-nazi "partisans"
*** [[Babi Yar]] a series of massacres in Kiev, the most notorious and the best documented of these massacres took place on 29–30 September 1941, wherein 33,771 Jews were killed in a single operation. The decision to kill all the Jews in Kiev was made by the military governor, Major-General Kurt Eberhard, the Police Commander for Army Group South, SS-Obergruppenführer Friedrich Jeckeln, and the Einsatzgruppe C Commander Otto Rasch. It was carried out by Sonderkommando 4a soldiers, along with the aid of the SD and SS Police Battalions backed by the local police.
*** [[Rumbula massacre|Rumbula]] a collective term for incidents on two non-consecutive days (November 30 and December 8, 1941) in which about 25,000 Jews were killed in or on the way to Rumbula forest near Riga, Latvia, during the Holocaust
*** [[Kaunas massacre of October 29, 1941|Ninth Fort]] By the order of SS-Standartenführer Karl Jäger and SS-Rottenführer [[Helmut Rauca]], the Sonderkommando under the leadership of SS-Obersturmführer Joachim Hamann, and 8 to 10 men from Einsatzkommando 3, in collaboration with Lithuanian partisans, murdered 2,007 Jewish men, 2,920 women, and 4,273 children in a single day at the Ninth Fort, Kaunas, Lithuania.
*** [[Simferopol]] Germans perpetrated one of the largest war-time massacres in Simferopol, killing in total over 22,000 locals—mostly [[Jews]], [[Russians]], [[Krymchaks]], and [[Romani people|Gypsies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.simferopol.ws|title=Simferopol|accessdate=2008-05-13|work=simferopol.ws|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; On one occasion, starting December 9, 1941, the [[Einsatzgruppen|Einsatzgruppen D]] under [[Otto Ohlendorf]]'s command killed an estimated 14,300 Simferopol residents, most of them being Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Das Personenlexikon zum Dritten Reich. Wer war was vor und nach 1945. Fischer Taschenbuch Verlag, Zweite aktualisierte Auflage, Frankfurt am Main 2005, page 72&lt;/ref&gt;
*** The massacre of 100,000 Jews and Poles at [[Ponary massacre|Paneriai]]
** The suppression of the 1943 [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]] which erupted when the SS came to clear the Jewish ghetto and send all of the occupants to extermination camps[[File:Alexandras Lileikis.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Lithuanian Security Police|Aleksandras Lileikis]], a Nazi unit commander who oversaw the murder of 60,000 Jews in [[Lithuania]]. He later worked for the [[CIA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=U.S. Recruited Over 1,000 ex-Nazis as anti-Communist Spies, NY Times Reports |url=https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/nyt-u-s-hired-over-1-000-ex-nazi-spies-1.5320583 |work=Haaretz |date=October 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;]] 
** [[Izieu|Izieu Massacre]] Izieu was the site of a Jewish orphanage during the Second World War. On 6 April 1944, three vehicles pulled up in front of the orphanage. The Gestapo, under the direction of the 'Butcher of Lyon' Klaus Barbie, entered the orphanage and forcibly removed the forty-four children and their seven supervisors, throwing the crying and terrified children on to the trucks. Following the raid on their home in Izieu, the children were shipped directly to the "collection center" in Drancy, then put on the first available train towards the concentration camps in the East.
Other crimes against humanity included:
* The [[Porajmos]], the mass killings of the [[Romani people|Romany]] peoples of Europe by the Nazis
* The [[Łapanka]] or "Catching Game", – Nazi roundups of Poles in the major cities for slave labor
* [[Nikolaev Massacre]], which resulted in the deaths of 35,782 Soviet citizens, most of whom were Jews.
* [[Operation Tannenberg]], the [[AB Action]] and the [[Massacre of Lwów professors]], all Nazi actions in Poland meant to mass murder the Polish intelligentsia and other potential leaders of resistance.
* Both "encouraging" and "compelling" abortion, prosecuted as a crime against the child in the womb. The crime consisted of three parts: (a) providing abortion services, (b) withdrawing the protection of German law from the unborn child, (c) refusing to enforce existing Polish law prohibiting abortion.&lt;ref&gt;Nuremberg and the Crime of Abortion, Jeffrey C.

* The Nazi [[T-4 Euthanasia Program]], an aborted eugenics program meant to kill German children who were mentally or physically handicapped. 200,000 people were murdered due to this program.

At least 10 million, and perhaps over 20 million perished directly and indirectly due to the commission of crimes against humanity and war crimes by the Nazi regime, of which the Holocaust lives on in particular infamy, for its particularly cruel nature and scope, and the industrialised nature of the genocide of Jewish citizens of states invaded or controlled by the Nazi regime. At least 5.9 million [[Jew]]s were murdered by the Nazis, or 66 to 78% of Europe's Jewish population, although a complete count may never be known. Though much of Continental Europe suffered under the Nazi occupation, Poland, in particular, was the state most devastated by these crimes, with 90% of its Jews as well as many ethnic Poles slaughtered by the Nazis and their Ukrainian affiliates. After the war, from 1945–49, the Nazi regime was put on trial in two [[Nuremberg Trials|tribunals]] in [[Nuremberg]], Germany by the victorious [[Allies of World War II|Allied powers]].

The [[Nuremberg Trials|first tribunal]] [[indictment|indicted]] 24 major Nazi war criminals, and resulted in 19 [[conviction (law)|convictions]] (of which 12 led to [[death sentence]]s) and 3 [[acquittal]]s, 2 of the accused died before a verdict was rendered, at least one of which by killing himself with cyanide.&lt;ref&gt;"Nuremberg: Tyranny on Trial", The History Channel, 40:30, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SJCPkmrYZw&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Subsequent Nuremberg Trials|second tribunal]] indicted 185 members of the military, economic, and political leadership of Nazi Germany, of which 142 were convicted and 35 were acquitted. In subsequent decades, approximately 20 additional war criminals who escaped capture in the immediate aftermath of World War II were tried in [[West Germany]] and Israel. In Germany and many other European nations, the Nazi Party and denial of the Holocaust is outlawed.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

====Crimes perpetrated by Italy====
{{Main|Italian war crimes}}
* Invasion of Abyssinia: Waging a war of aggression for territorial aggrandisement, war crimes, use of poisons as weapons, crimes against humanity; in violation of the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the customary law of nations, Italy invaded the Kingdom of Abyssinia in 1936 without cause cognizable by the law of nations, and waged a war of annihilation against Ethiopian resistance, using poisons against military forces and civilian persons alike, not giving quarter to POWs who had surrendered, and massacring civilians.
* Invasion of Albania: Waging a war of aggression for territorial aggrandisement; Italy invaded the Kingdom of Albania in 1939 without cause cognizable by the law of nations in a brief but bloody affair that saw King Zog deposed and an Italian proconsul installed in his place. Italy subsequently acted as the suzerain of Albania until its ultimate liberation later in World War II.
* Invasion of Yugoslavia: Aerial bombardment of civilian population; concentration camps (Rab, Gonars)
* No one has been brought to trial for war crimes, although in 1950 the former Italian defense minister was convicted for collaboration with Nazi Germany.

||General [[Tomoyuki Yamashita]] (and Chief of Staff [[Akira Mutō]]) 
||As commander of the [[Japanese Fourteenth Area Army|14th Area Army of Japan]] in the Philippines, General Yamashita failed to stop his troops from killing over 100,000 Filipinos in [[Manila]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=White|first=Matthew|title=Death Tolls for the Man-made Megadeaths of the 20th century|url=http://users.erols.com/mwhite28/battles.htm#Manila|accessdate=2007-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; while fighting with both native resistance forces and elements of the [[Sixth United States Army|Sixth U.S. Army]] during the capture of the city in February 1945.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Yamashita pleaded inability to act and lack of knowledge of the massacre, due to his commanding other operations in the area. The defense failed, establishing the [[Yamashita Standard]], which holds that a commander who makes no meaningful effort to uncover and stop atrocities is as culpable as if he had ordered them. His chief of staff [[Akira Mutō]] was condemned by the [[Tokyo tribunal]].{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

====Crimes perpetrated by the Chetniks====
[[Chetniks|Chetnik]] ideology revolved around the notion of a [[Greater Serbia]] within the borders of Yugoslavia, to be created out of all territories in which Serbs were found, even if the numbers were small. A directive dated 20 December 1941, addressed to newly appointed commanders in Montenegro, Major Đorđije Lašić and Captain Pavle Đurišić, outlined, among other things, the cleansing of all non-Serb elements in order to create a Greater Serbia:{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=170}}

{{quote|
# The struggle for the liberty of our whole nation under the scepter of His Majesty King Peter II;
# the creation of a Great Yugoslavia and within it of a [[Great Serbia]] which is to be ethnically pure and is to include Serbia, [[Montenegro]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Srijem]], the [[Banat]], and [[Bačka]];
# the struggle for the inclusion into Yugoslavia of all still unliberated Slovene territories under the Italians and Germans ([[Trieste]], [[Gorizia]], [[Istria]], and [[Slovenian Carinthia|Carinthia]]) as well as Bulgaria, and northern [[Albania]] with [[Skadar]];
# the cleansing of the state territory of all national minorities and a-national elements;
# the creation of contiguous frontiers between Serbia and Montenegro, as well as between Serbia and [[Slovenia]] by cleansing the Muslim population from [[Sandžak]] and the Muslim and Croat populations from Bosnia and Herzegovina.|sign=Directive of 20 December 1941{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=170}}}}
[[File:Chetniks in Šumadija kill a Partisan through heart extraction.jpg|thumb|Chetniks in [[Šumadija]] kill a Partisan through heart extraction]]
The Chetniks systemically massacred Muslims in villages that they captured.{{sfn|Hoare|2006|p=143}} In late autumn of 1941 the Italians handed over the towns of Višegrad, Goražde, Foča and the surrounding areas, in south-east Bosnia to the Chetniks to run as a puppet administration and NDH forces were compelled by the Italians to withdraw from there. After the Chetniks gained control of [[Goražde]] on 29 November 1941, they began a massacre of Home Guard prisoners and NDH officials that became a systematic massacre of the local Muslim civilian population.{{sfn|Hoare|2006|p=145}}

Several hundred Muslims were murdered and their bodies were left hanging in the town or thrown into the Drina river.{{sfn|Hoare|2006|p=145}} On 5 December 1941, the Chetniks received the town of [[Foča]] from the Italians and proceeded to massacre around 500 Muslims.{{sfn|Hoare|2006|p=145}} Additional massacres against the Muslims in the area of Foča took place in August 1942. In total, more than 2000 people were killed in Foča.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|pp=256–61}}

In early January, Chetniks entered [[Srebrenica]] and killed around 1000 Muslim civilians there and in nearby villages. Around the same time the Chetniks made their way to [[Višegrad]] where deaths were reportedly in the thousands.{{sfn|Hoare|2006|pp=146-47}} Massacres continued in the following months in the region.{{sfn|Hoare|2006|p=146}} In the village of [[Žepa]] alone about three hundred were killed in late 1941.{{sfn|Hoare|2006|p=146}} In early January, Chetniks massacred fifty-four Muslims in [[Čelebić]] and burned down the village. On 3 March, Chetniks burned forty-two Muslim villagers to death in Drakan.{{sfn|Hoare|2006|pp=146-47}}

In early January 1943 and again in early February, Montenegrin Chetnik units were ordered to carry out "cleansing actions" against Muslims, first in the [[Bijelo Polje]] county in Sandžak and then in February in the [[Čajniče]] county and part of Foča county in southeastern Bosnia, and in part of the [[Pljevlja]] county in Sandžak.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|pp=258–59}}

[[Pavle Đurišić]], the officer in charge of these operations, reported to Mihailović, Chief of Staff of the Supreme Command, that on 10 January 1943: "thirty-three Muslim villages had been burned down, and 400 Muslim fighters (members of the Muslim self-protection militia supported by the Italians) and about 1,000 women and children had been killed, as against 14 Chetnik dead and 26 wounded".{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|pp=258–59}}

In another report sent by Đurišić dated 13 February 1943, he reported that: "Chetniks killed about 1,200 Muslim fighters and about 8,000 old people, women, and children; Chetnik losses in the action were 22 killed and 32 wounded".{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|pp=258–59}} He added that "during the operation the total destruction of the Muslim inhabitants was carried out regardless of sex and age".{{sfn|Hoare|2006|p=331}} The total number of deaths caused by the anti-Muslim operations between January and February 1943 is estimated at 10,000.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|pp=258–59}} The casualty rate would have been higher had a great number of Muslims not already fled the area, most to [[Sarajevo]], when the February action began.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|pp=258–59}} According to a statement from the Chetnik Supreme Command from 24 February 1943, these were countermeasures taken against Muslim aggressive activities; however, all circumstances show that these massacres were committed in accordance with implementing the directive of 20 December 1941.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|pp=256–61}}

Actions against the Croats were of a smaller scale but comparable in action.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|p=259}} In early October 1942 in the village of [[Gata, Croatia|Gata]], where an estimated 100 people were killed and many homes burnt in reprisal taken for the destruction of roads in the area carried out on the Italians' account.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|pp=256–61}} That same month, formations under the command of Petar Baćović and Dobroslav Jevđević, who were participating in the Italian [[Operation Alfa]] in the area of [[Prozor-Rama|Prozor]], massacred over 500 Croats and Muslims and burnt numerous villages.{{sfn|Tomasevich|1975|pp=256–61}} Baćović noted that "Our Chetniks killed all men 15 years of age or older.&amp;nbsp;... Seventeen villages were burned to the ground."{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=146}} [[Mario Roatta]], commander of the [[Second Army (Italy)|Italian Second Army]], objected to these "massive slaughters" of noncombatant civilians and threatened to halt Italian aid to the Chetniks if they did not end.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=146}}

====Crimes perpetrated by the Ustashas====
The [[Ustaša]] intended to create an ethnically "pure" [[Greater Croatia]], and they viewed those [[Serbs]] then living in Croatia, [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]] and [[Herzegovina]] as the biggest obstacle to this goal. Ustasha ministers [[Mile Budak]], Mirko Puk and Milovan Žanić declared in May 1941 that the goal of the new Ustasha policy was an ethnically pure Croatia. The strategy to achieve their goal was:&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Adam &amp; Nicholas A. Robins. (2009), [https://books.google.com/books?id=AX3UCk_PdEwC&amp;pg=PA106 ''Genocides by the oppressed: subaltern genocide in theory and practice''], p. 106, Indiana University Press; {{ISBN|978-0-253-22077-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jacobs"&gt;Jacobs, Steven L.

# One-third of the Serbs were to be killed
# One-third of the Serbs were to be expelled
# One-third of the Serbs were to be forcibly converted to [[Roman Catholicism|Catholicism]]
 
The [[Independent State of Croatia]] government cooperated with Nazi Germany in [[The Holocaust in the Independent State of Croatia|the Holocaust]] and exercised their own version of the [[Genocide of Serbs in the Independent State of Croatia|genocide]] against Serbs, as well as [[Jews]] and [[Romani people|Gypsies]] (Roma) (aka "gypsies") inside its borders. State policy towards Serbs had first been declared in the words of Milovan Žanić, a minister of the NDH Legislative council, on 2 May 1941:

[[File:Ustaše sawing off the head of a Serb civilian.jpg|thumb|left|225px|left|Ustaša soldiers sawing off the head of Branko Jungić, an ethnic Serb, near [[Gradiška, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosanska Gradiška]].]]

&lt;blockquote&gt;This country can only be a Croatian country, and there is no method we would hesitate to use in order to make it truly Croatian and cleanse it of Serbs, who have for centuries endangered us and who will endanger us again if they are given the opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/PUB159.pdf|title=Deciphering the Balkan Enigma: Using History to Inform Policy|format=PDF|accessdate=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; According to the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]] (citing the ''[[Encyclopedia of the Holocaust]]''), "Ustasa terrorists killed 500,000 Serbs, expelled 250,000 and forced 250,000 to convert to Roman Catholicism. They murdered thousands of Jews and Gypsies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Simon Wiesenthal Center Multimedia Learning Center|url=http://motlc.wiesenthal.com/pages/t081/t08100.html|accessdate=8 November 2002|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021108152138/http://motlc.wiesenthal.com/pages/t081/t08100.html|archivedate=8 November 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The execution methods used by the Ustasha were particularly brutal and sadistic and often included torture, dismemberment or decapitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Black |first1=Edwin |title=The Holocaust’s Most Vicious Killers |url=https://www.jewishpress.com/indepth/the-holocausts-most-vicious-killers-2/2011/01/19/ |work=The Jewish Press |date=January 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Gestapo report to Heinrich Himmler from 1942 stated, "The Ustaše committed their deeds in a bestial manner not only against males of conscript age but especially against helpless old people, women and children."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Goni |first1=Uki |title=The Real Odessa: Smuggling the Nazis to Peron's Argentina |date=September 2002 |publisher=Granta Books |isbn=1862075816 |page=202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous concentration camps were built in the NDH, most notably [[Jasenovac concentration camp|Jasenovac]], the largest, where around 100,000 Serbs, Jews, Roma, as well as a number of Croatian political dissidents, died, mostly from torture and starvation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Yeomans |first1=Rory |title=The Utopia of Terror: Life and Death in Wartime Croatia |date=2015 |publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer |isbn=1580465455 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was established in August 1941 and not dismantled until April 1945, shortly before the end of the war.

====Crimes perpetrated by the Ukrainian nationalists====
The Ukrainian [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists|OUN-B]] group, along with their military force – [[Ukrainian Insurgent Army]](UPA) – are responsible for a [[Massacres of Poles in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia|genocide on the Polish population in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia]]. Starting in March 1943, with its peak in the summer 1943, as many as 130,000 people (according to [[Ewa Siemaszko]]) were murdered, mostly women, children and elderly. Although the main target were [[Poles]], many [[Jews]], [[Czechs]] and those [[Ukrainians]] unwilling to participate in the crimes, were massacred as well. Lacking good armament and ammunition, UPA members commonly used tools such as axes and pitchforks for the slaughter. As a result of these massacres, almost the entire non-Ukrainian population of Volhynia was either killed or forced to flee.

UPA commanders responsible for the genocide:
* [[Roman Shukhevych]] - general of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army. As a leader of the UPA he was to be aware and to approve the project of ethnic cleansing in [[Volhynia]] and Eastern Galicia.
* [[Dmytro Klyachkivsky]] - colonel of the UPA. He gave the order "to wipe out an entire Polish male population between 16 and 60 years old". Klyachkivsky is regarded as the main initiator of the massacres.
* [[Mykola Lebed]] - one of the OUN leaders, and UPA fighter. By the National Archives, he is described as "Ukrainian fascist leader and suspected [[Nazism|Nazi]] collaborator"
* [[Stepan Bandera]] - leader of the OUN-B. His view was to remove all Poles, who were hostile towards the OUN, and assimilate the rest of them. The role of the main architect of the massacres is often assigned to him. However, he was imprisoned in German concentration camp since 1941, so there is a strong suspicion, that he wasn't fully aware of events in Volhynia.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

It was recaptured by the Germans soon afterwards and the German authorities reported that the Red Army killed civilians there. [[Nazi]] propaganda widely disseminated the description of the event with horrible details, supposedly to boost the determination of German soldiers to resist the general Soviet advance. Because the incident was investigated by the Nazis and reports were disseminated as Nazi propaganda, discerning the facts from the fiction of the incident is difficult.

* [[Rudolph Rummel]] estimated that the North Korean Army executed at least 500,000 civilians during the Korean War with many dying in North Korea's drive to conscript South Koreans to their war effort. Throughout the conflict, North Korean and Chinese forces routinely mistreated U.S. and UN prisoners of war. Mass starvation and diseases swept through the Chinese-run [[POW camps]] during the winter of 1950–51. About 43 percent of all U.S. POWs died during this period. In violation of the [[Geneva Conventions]] which explicitly stated that captor states must [[repatriate]] prisoners of war to their homeland as quickly as possible, North Korea detained South Korean POWs for decades after the ceasefire. Over 88,000 South Korean soldiers were missing and the Communists' themselves had claimed they had captured 70,000 South Koreans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/SOD.CHAP10.HTM |title = STATISTICS OF DEMOCIDE Chapter 10 |publisher= |accessdate=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Heo2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Heo |first=Man-ho |title=North Korea's Continued Detention of South Korean POWs since the Korean and Vietnam Wars |journal=The Korean Journal of Defense Analysis |year=2002 |volume=14 |issue=2 |url=http://www.kida.re.kr/data/2006/04/14/08-heo.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160108084151/http://www.kida.re.kr/data/2006/04/14/08-heo.pdf |archivedate=2016-01-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|141}}

== 1952–1960: Mau Mau uprising ==
{{Main|Mau Mau uprising#War_crimes}}
* In attempt to suppress the insurgency in [[Kenya]], British colonial authorities suspended [[civil liberties]] within the country. In response to the rebellion, many Kikuyu were relocated. 320,000–450,000 of them were moved into [[concentration camps]]. Most of the remainder – more than a million – were held in "enclosed villages". Although some were Mau Mau guerillas, many were victims of [[collective punishment]] that colonial authorities imposed on large areas of the country. Thousands suffered beatings and [[sexual assaults]] during "screenings" intended to extract information about the Mau Mau threat. Later, prisoners suffered even worse mistreatment in an attempt to force them to renounce their allegiance to the insurgency and to obey commands. Significant numbers were murdered; official accounts describe some prisoners being roasted alive. Prisoners were questioned with the help of "slicing off ears, boring holes in eardrums, flogging until death, pouring paraffin over suspects who were then set alight, and burning eardrums with lit cigarettes". British soldiers used a "metal [[castrating]] instrument" to cut off testicles and fingers. "By the time I cut his balls off", one settler boasted, "he had no ears, and his eyeball, the right one, I think, was hanging out of its socket. Too bad, he died before we got much out of him." According to David Anderson,{{who|date=August 2017}} the British hanged over 1,090 suspected rebels: far more than the French had executed in [[Algeria]] during the [[Algerian War]]. It was found out that over half of them executed were not rebels at all. Thousands more were [[summarily executed|killed]] by British soldiers, who claimed they had "failed to halt" when challenged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=WEB OF DECEIT: BRITAIN'S REAL FOREIGN POLICY: BRITAIN'S REAL ROLE IN THE WORLD|pages=324–30|publisher=VINTAGE|author=Mark Curtis|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Britain's gulag: the brutal end of empire in Kenya|pages=124–45|publisher=Pimlico|author=Caroline Elkins|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Histories of the Hanged: The Dirty War in Kenya and the End of Empire|pages=150–54|publisher=W.W.

* The [[Chuka Massacre]], which happened in [[Chuka, Kenya]], was perpetrated by members of the [[King's African Rifles]] B Company in June 1953 with 20 unarmed people killed during the Mau Mau uprising. Members of the 5th KAR B Company entered the Chuka area on June 13, 1953, to flush out rebels suspected of hiding in the nearby forests. Over the next few days, the regiment had captured and executed 20 people suspected of being Mau Mau fighters for unknown reasons. It is found out that most of the people executed were actually belonged to the [[Kikuyu Home Guard]] – a loyalist militia recruited by the British to fight an increasingly powerful and audacious guerrilla enemy. In an atmosphere of atrocity and reprisal, the matter was swept under the carpet and nobody ever stood trial for the massacre.
* The [[Hola massacre]] was an incident during the conflict in [[Kenya]] against [[British colonial rule]] at a colonial detention camp in [[Hola, Kenya]]. By January 1959 the camp had a population of 506 detainees of whom 127 were held in a secluded "closed camp". This more remote camp near Garissa, eastern Kenya, was reserved for the most uncooperative of the detainees. They often refused, even when threats of force were made, to join in the colonial "rehabilitation process" or perform manual labour or obey colonial orders. The camp commandant outlined a plan that would force 88 of the detainees to bend to work. On 3 March 1959, the camp commandant put this plan into action – as a result, 11 detainees were clubbed to death by guards.&lt;ref&gt;Maloba, Wunyabari O. Mau Mau and Kenya: An Analysis of a Peasant Revolt.(Indiana University Press, Bloomington, IN: 1993) pp. 142–43.&lt;/ref&gt; 77 surviving detainees sustained serious permanent injuries.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} The British government accepts that the colonial administration tortured detainees, but denies liability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-20543140|title=Mau Mau massacre documents revealed|work=BBC News|date=30 November 2012|accessdate=6 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Lari massacre in the settlement of [[Lari Constituency|Lari]] occurred on the night of 25–26 March 1953, in which Mau Mau militants herded Kikuyu men, women and children into huts and set fire to them, killing anyone who attempted to escape. Official estimates place the death toll from the Lari massacre at 74 dead.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, David (2005). Histories of the Hanged. W.W.

Two Marines were dispatched to retrieve McGhee and as they approached the village they heard a shot and a woman's scream and then saw McGhee walking toward them from the village. McGhee said he had just killed a VC and other VC were following him. At trial Vietnamese prosecution witnesses testified that McGhee had kicked through the wall of the hut where their family slept. He seized a 14-year-old girl and pulled her toward the door. When her father interceded, McGhee shot and killed him. Once outside the house the girl escaped McGhee with the help of her grandmother. McGhee was found guilty of unpremeditated murder and sentenced him to confinement at hard labor for ten years.

While they beat him, other patrol members forced his wife, Bui Thi Huong, from their hut and four of them raped her. A few minutes later three other patrol members shot Dao Quang Thinh, Bui, their child, Bui's sister-in-law, and her sister in- law's child. Bui Thi Huong survived to testify at the courts-martial. The company commander suspicious of the reported "enemy contact" sent Second Lieutenant Stephen J. Talty, to return to the scene with the patrol. Once there, Talty realized what had happened and attempted to cover up the incident. A wounded child was discovered alive and Potter bludgeoned it to death with his rifle. Potter was convicted of premeditated murder and rape, and sentenced to confinement at hard labor for life, but was released in February 1978, having served 12 years and 1 month. Hospitalman John R.

And so, incredibly, children are not only the main victims of this war, but also its unwilling perpetrators... The girls told me they had been given to rebel commanders as "wives" and forced to bear them children. The boys said they had been forced to walk for days knowing they would be killed if they showed any weakness, and in some cases forced even to murder their family members... every night up to 10,000 children walk into the centre of [[Kitgum]]... because they are not safe in their own beds... more than 25,000 children have been kidnapped ...this year an average of 20 children have been abducted every week.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* The [[International Criminal Court]] has launched an investigation and has issued indictments against LRA leaders.

Throughout the 1990s, his armies and supporters, made up of child soldiers orphaned by the conflict wreaked havoc through a swath of West Africa. In Sierra Leone he supported the [[Revolutionary United Front]] (R.U.F) whose rebel fighters were notorious for hacking off the limbs of civilians.''
* Current action – Indicted on 17 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity by the UN, which has issued an international warrant for his arrest. As of April 2006 located, extradited, and facing trial in [[Sierra Leone]] but then transferred to the Netherlands as requested by the [[Liberia]]n government. As of the status of the main state actor in the war crimes in Liberia, Sierra Leone and the ongoing war crimes tribunal in the Hague for violating the UN sanctions, Libya's Muamar Gaddafi was elected to the post of President of the African Union. As of late January, 2011, Exxon/Mobile has resumed explorationary drilling in Libya after the exchange of the Lockerbie bombing terrorist was returned to Libya and Libya was taken off terrorist list by the Bush administration with the legal stipulation that Libya could never be prosecuted for past war crimes(regardless of guilt)in the future.

== 1991–2000/2002: Algerian Civil War ==
{{Main|List of massacres during the Algerian Civil War}}

During the [[Algerian Civil War]] of the 1990s, a variety of [[massacre]]s occurred through the country, many being identified as war crimes. The [[Armed Islamic Group|Armed Islamic Group (GIA)]] has avowed its responsibility for many of them, while for others no group has claimed responsibility.  In addition to generating a widespread sense of fear, these massacres and the ensuing flight of population have resulted in serious depopulation of the worst-affected areas.  The massacres peaked in 1997 (with a smaller peak in 1994), and were particularly concentrated in the areas between [[Algiers]] and [[Oran]], with very few occurring in the east or in the [[Sahara]].

It eventually admitted to its limited use and stopped using the shells, including as a [[smoke screen]]. The [[Goldstone report]] investigating possible war crimes in the 2009 war accepted that white phosphorus is not illegal under international law but did find that the Israelis were "systematically reckless in determining its use in build-up areas".

'''Human shields''' may be civilians used against their will to deter attacks on military targets during an international armed conflict or they may be civilians who voluntarily protect either military or civilian targets from attack. The use of human shields is forbidden by ''[[Protocol I]]'' of the [[Geneva Conventions]]. It is also a [[specific intent]] [[war crime]] as codified in the ''[[Rome Statute]]'', which was adopted in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court(ICC), art.8(20)(f) July 17, 1998, 2187 U.N.T.S. 3; {{bluebook journal |last=Schmitt |first=Michael |title=Human Shields in International Humanitarian Law |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/cjtl47&amp;start_page=292&amp;collection=journals&amp;id=298 |year=2009 |volume=47 |journal=Colum. J. Transnat'l L. |page=292}}&lt;/ref&gt; The language of the ''Rome Statute'' prohibits "utilizing the presence of a civilian or other protected person to render certain points, areas, or military forces immune from military operations."&lt;ref&gt;International Criminal Court, Elements of Crimes, art.8(2)(b)(xxiii), U.N. Doc. PCINICC/2000/1/Add.2 (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically the law of armed conflict only applied to sovereign states. Non-international conflicts were governed by the domestic law of the State concerned. Under the current terms of the ''Rome Statute'' the use of human shields is defined as a war crime only in the context of an international armed conflict.&lt;ref&gt;International Criminal Court, Elements of Crimes, art.8(2)(b)(xxiii), U.N. Doc. PCINICC/2000/1/Add.2 (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

After the end of World War II, non-international armed conflicts have become more commonplace. The ''Customary International Humanitarian Law'' guide suggests that rules prohibiting use of civilians as human shields are "arguably" customary in non-international armed conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bluebook website |last=Henckaerts |first=Jean-Marie | last2=Doswald-Beck | first2=Louise |title=Customary International Humanitarian Law |publisher=International Committee of the Red Cross |url=https://www.icrc.org/eng/assets/files/other/customary-international-humanitarian-law-i-icrc-eng.pdf |date=2005}};[hereinafter CIHL]&lt;/ref&gt;  The development and application of humanitarian law to modern asymmetric warfare is currently being debated by legal scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bluebook website| last=Marauhn |first=Thilo |title=Armed Conflict, Non-International |publisher=MPEPIL |url=http://opil.ouplaw.com/view/10.1093/law:epil/9780199231690/law-9780199231690-e243?result=1&amp;rskey=gZ7eSJ&amp;prd=OPIL |date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{See also|Human shield}}
The laws of war first began to develop the [[Distinction (law)|distinction]] between military and civilian targets at The Second Hague Peace Conference of 1907.&lt;ref&gt;{{bluebook journal |last=Reynolds |first=Jefferson D. |title=Collateral Damage on the 21st Century Battlefield: Enemy Exploitation of the Law of Armed Conflict, and the Struggle for a Moral High Ground |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/airfor56&amp;start_page=1&amp;collection=journals&amp;id=5 |year=2005 |volume=56 |journal=A.F. L. Rev.| page=1}}, at 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

During World War I, the concept of total war permitted most actions that supported the war effort. In "total war" targeting civilians was allowed, if it would support a military objective to demoralize the enemy. Indiscriminate bombing was considered an acceptable method to achieve the military advantage of defeating enemy morale and eroding popular support for the war effort.&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.,''{{bluebook journal |last=Artz |first=Margaret |title=Chink in the Armor: How a Uniform Approach to Proportionality Analysis Can End the Use of Human Shields |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/vantl45&amp;start_page=1447&amp;collection=journals&amp;id=1469 |year=2012 |volume=45 |journal=Vand. J. Transnat'l L. |page=1447}}, at 1453;{{bluebook journal |last=Reynolds |first=Jefferson D. |title=Collateral Damage on the 21st Century Battlefield: Enemy Exploitation of the Law of Armed Conflict, and the Struggle for a Moral High Ground |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/airfor56&amp;start_page=1&amp;collection=journals&amp;id=5 |year=2005 |volume=56 |journal=A.F. L. Rev.|page=56}}, at 10;&lt;/ref&gt; Early attempts to protect civilians as a class were largely unsuccessful. World War II was also fought within the framework of the total war concept.&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.,''{{Smallcaps|Horst Boog, Et al.,7 Germany and the Second World War 10 (2006).}}(quoting the Casablanca Directive, which described Allied strategy as "the progressive destruction and dislocation of the German military, industrial, and economic system, and the undermining of the morale of the German people to a point where their capacity for armed resistance is fatally weakened")&lt;/ref&gt;

The Geneva Conventions of 1949 were the first significant protections for civilians in war. These protections were expanded by the Additional Protocols in 1977. Protocol I requires that attacks be limited to military objectives, which are defined as targets that make an "effective contribution to military action" where the destruction of the target provides a "definite military advantage" to the attacker.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Protocol I, art. 52(2)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal doctrine ==
{{quote box|width=30%|align=right|quote=Attacks shall be strictly limited to military objectives. In so far as objects are concerned, military objectives are limited to those objects which by their nature, location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage.|source=—Protocol I, Geneva Conventions&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Protocol  Additional  to the Geneva Conventions  of August  12,  1949,  and Relating to the
Protection  of Victims of International Armed Conflicts  (Protocol  I), opened for signature Dec.
12,  1977,  1125  U.N.T.S.  3, art. 52(2) [hereinafter  Protocol  I].&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Military necessity can justify the use of force in certain circumstances, where there is a military advantage to be gained by an attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{bluebook journal |last=Reynolds |first=Jefferson D. |title=Collateral Damage on the 21st Century Battlefield: Enemy Exploitation of the Law of Armed Conflict, and the Struggle for a Moral High Ground |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/airfor56&amp;start_page=1&amp;collection=journals&amp;id=5 |year=2005 |volume=56 |journal=A.F. L. Rev.| page=1}}, at 15.&lt;/ref&gt;  When the use of force is excessive relative to its anticipated military advantage it is said to be disproportionate. Disproportionate force is prohibited under international law.

Risk to civilians does not bar military action, but the principle of proportionality requires that precautions be taken to minimize the harm to these protected persons. This analysis includes considerations like whether circumstances permit the attacker to time a military action to minimize the presence of civilians at the location.&lt;ref&gt;{{bluebook journal |last=Bartels |first=Rogier |title=Dealing with the Principle of Proportionality in Armed Conflict in Retrospect: The Application of the Principle in International Criminal Trials |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/israel46&amp;start_page=271&amp;collection=journals&amp;id=275 |year= |volume=46 |journal=Israel Law Review |page=271}}, at 303&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the Rome Statute using protected persons as shields in an international armed conflict is a war crime.&lt;ref&gt;International Criminal Court, Elements of Crimes, art.8(2)(b)(xxiii), U.N. Doc. PCINICC/2000/1/Add.2 (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; There is currently debate amongst legal scholars about whether traditional proportionality analysis should be modified to take into account the culpability of actors who use human shields to gain a strategic advantage. In modern asymmetric warfare it has become difficult to distinguish between military targets and civilians, but State actors still rely on traditional principles that present challenges when applied to asymmetric conflicts. Non-state forces, like guerillas and terrorists, conceal themselves among civilian populations and may take advantage of this position to launch attacks. When military action targeting these unconventional combatants results in civilian deaths, State actors may blame the deaths on enemy forces who use human shields.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bluebook website |last=Cassese |first=Antonio |title=Current Challenges to International Humanitarian Law |publisher=Oxford  |url=http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/law/9780199559695.001.0001/law-9780199559695-e-1 |date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Proportionate proportionality analysis ===
{{quote box|width=30%|align=right|quote=Military necessity permits a belligerent, subject to the laws of war, to apply any amount and kind of force to compel the complete submission of the enemy with the least possible expenditure of time, life, and money . . . it permits the destruction of life, of armed enemies and other persons whose destruction is incidentally unavoidable . . . but does not permit the killing of innocent inhabitants for purposes of revenge or the satisfaction of a lust to kill. |source=—''United States v. List'', The Nuremberg Trials&lt;ref&gt;Agreement for the Prosecution and Punishment of the Major War Criminals of the European Axis, and Charter of the International Military Trubunal, Aug. 8, 1945, 82 U.N.T.S. 279.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Some scholars, including Ammon Rubinstein and Yaniv Roznai, argue that the use of human shields should be a factor in determining whether the use of force was justifiable under the guiding principles of [[Distinction (law)|distinction]] and [[Proportionality (law)|proportionality]]. In their view, the use of human shields undermines an attackers right to self defense because the military necessity of self-defense must be a consideration in the excessive force analysis. Rubinstein and Roznai have described this analysis as a "proportionate proportionality."&lt;ref&gt;''See'' {{bluebook journal |last1=Rubinstein |first=Ammon |last=Roznai |first2=Yaniv |title=Human Shields in Modern Armed Conflicts: The Need for a Proportionate Proportionality |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/stanlp22&amp;start_page=93&amp;collection=journals&amp;id=95 |year=2011|volume=22 |journal=Stan.

U. L. Rev. |page=479}}(arguing that an analysis based on proportionality and distinction that does not discount attackers culpability when human shields are used "unfairly undermines the right to self-defense"), at 490&lt;/ref&gt;

Rubinstein and Roznai argue that an attack that would be disproportionate ought to be considered proportionate, if the presence of civilians is due to the wrongful actions of the enemy.  They use the term "impeded party" to describe the burden placed on the attacking party under International Humanitarian Law norms. They point out that "attacking party" has traditionally been synonymous with the aggressor, but that it is often the attacker who is "defending democracy" and acting in self-defense when they use force in response to a prior attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{bluebook journal |last1=Rubinstein |first=Ammon |last=Roznai |first2=Yaniv |title=Human Shields in Modern Armed Conflicts: The Need for a Proportionate Proportionality |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/stanlp22&amp;start_page=93&amp;collection=journals&amp;id=95 |year=2011|volume=22 |journal=Stan. L. &amp; Pol'y Rev.'|page=93}}, at 95&lt;/ref&gt;

Douglas Fischer believes that the increase of civilian casualties that began with the Vietnam War is partially due to an increased use of "illegal and perfidious" tactics in modern warfare, including the use of civilians as human shields.&lt;ref&gt;{{bluebook journal |last=Fischer |first=Douglas H. |title=Human Shields,a Homicides, and House Fires: How a Domestic Law Analogy Can Guide International Law Regarding Human Shield Tactics in Armed Conflict |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/aulr57&amp;start_page=479&amp;collection=journals&amp;id=492 |year=2007 |volume=57 |journal=Am. U. L. Rev. |page=479}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has criticized Human Rights Watch for not including human shields doctrine as a factor in excessive force analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{bluebook journal |last=Fischer |first=Douglas H. |title=Human Shields,a Homicides, and House Fires: How a Domestic Law Analogy Can Guide International Law Regarding Human Shield Tactics in Armed Conflict |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/aulr57&amp;start_page=479&amp;collection=journals&amp;id=492 |year=2007 |volume=57 |journal=Am. U. L. Rev. |page=479}}, at 488-89 (arguing that attackers can not meet Article 57 obligations to take "precationary measures" unless defenders separate civilian and military targets.)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Voluntary and involuntary ===
Combatants in an armed conflict are prohibited from using protected civilians as involuntary human shields to support an unjust war effort. Civilians who are used as involuntary human shields by unlawful combatants do not lose their basic rights.&lt;ref name=OHEW&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Haque |first=Adil Ahmed |editor-last=Lazar |editor-first=Seth  |encyclopedia=The Oxford Handbook of Ethics and War |title=Human Shields |date=2016 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-994341-8|}}; {{bluebook journal |last=Schmitt |first=Michael |title=Human Shields in International Humanitarian Law |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/cjtl47&amp;start_page=292&amp;collection=journals&amp;id=298 |year=2009 |volume=47 |journal=Colum. J. Transnat'l L. |page=292}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of involuntary human shields does not release the other party from legal obligations to not target civilians or inflict excessive collateral damage.

Voluntary human shields may be considered "direct participants in hostilities," if they shield targeted personnel or properties. This could also be considered treason. However, if they are shielding protected personnel or properties, they may still retain their protected status. This debated area of customary international law has not yet been codified.&lt;ref&gt;{{bluebook journal |last=al-Duaij |first=Nada |title=The Volunteer Human Shields in International Humanitarian Law |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/porril12&amp;start_page=117&amp;collection=journals&amp;id=121 |year=2010 |volume=12 |journal=Or. Rev. Int'l L. |page=117}}, at 117-122&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States and the European Union are considered the main sources for voluntary human shields. In 2003, human rights activists travelled to Baghdad to serve as human shields and protest the unpopular U.S. invasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{bluebook journal |last=al-Duaij |first=Nada |title=The Volunteer Human Shields in International Humanitarian Law |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/porril12&amp;start_page=117&amp;collection=journals&amp;id=121 |year=2010 |volume=12 |journal=Or. Rev. Int'l L. |page=117}}, at 117-120&lt;/ref&gt;
Also in 2003, American peace activist [[Rachel Corrie]] was killed after she was crushed to death by an Israeli army bulldozer in [[Rafah]] while volunteering with the [[International Solidarity Movement]] as a human shield to prevent the demolition of homes in Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;{{bluebook journal |last=Maalouf |first=Kristina |title=The Political Question Doctrine in the Ninth Circuit and Why it Should not have Barred the Adjudication of ''Corrie v. Caterpillar'' |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/ggulr44&amp;start_page=35&amp;collection=journals&amp;id=71 |year=2014 |volume=44 |journal=Golden Gate U.L L. Rev |page=35}}, at 36&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Current limitations of IHL ===
While IHL does prohibit attacks on civilians, the precautions a power must take before an attack remain ill-defined. Proportionality remains a nebulous standard that does not set a predictable standard of when a military action would be considered lawful. There is a lack of enforcement, and the increasing role of private actors and contractors on the battlefield presents new challenges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bluebook website |last=Cassese |first=Antonio |title=Current Challenges to International Humanitarian Law |publisher=Oxford  |url=http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/law/9780199559695.001.0001/law-9780199559695-e-1 |date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== U.S. law ===
During the Civil War, the United States adopted the [[Lieber Code]], recognized by many scholars as the first detailed code governing conduct in war. Dr. [[Francis Lieber]] articulated an early version of the principle of proportionality: that civilians were not to be targeted, but were also not immune in all circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{bluebook journal |last=Artz |first=Margaret |title=Chink in the Armor: How a Uniform Approach to Proportionality Analysis Can End the Use of Human Shields |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/vantl45&amp;start_page=1447&amp;collection=journals&amp;id=1469 |year=2012 |volume=45 |journal=Vand. J. Transnat'l L. |page=1447}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of human shields is prohibited and defined as a war crime by several U.S. military manuals. It is also defined as a crime triable by military commission under the US Military Commissions Act (2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{Bluebook website |title=Customary IHL – Practice Relating to Rule 97. Human Shields |publisher=International Committee for the Red Cross |url=https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v2_cou_us_rule97 |date= 12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern warfare tactic ==
If the belligerent attacks in areas where human shields are used, this can weaken international and domestic support by exploiting harmed civilians. For nations that are particularly sensitive to collateral damage, an enemy's use of shields may effectively deter or delay military actions.

There have been numerous documented incidents where this tactic has not been successful in deterring attacks, including the [[Amiriyah shelter bombing]] during the [[Persian Gulf War|First Gulf War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bluebook journal |last=al-Duaij |first=Nada |title=The Volunteer Human Shields in International Humanitarian Law |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/porril12&amp;start_page=117&amp;collection=journals&amp;id=121 |year=2010 |volume=12 |journal=Or. Rev. Int'l L. |page=117}}, at 122&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of two Western activists serving as voluntary human shields in Gaza, Véronique Dudouet wrote that human shields have become less effective, since bad media publicity no longer deters soldiers from using lethal force against them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Smallcaps|Véronique Dudouet, People Power: Unarmed Resistance and Global Solidarity 131 (2000).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{War}}
A '''war of aggression''', sometimes also '''war of conquest'''&lt;!-- redirected here---&gt;, is a [[military conflict]] waged without the justification of [[self-defense]], usually for territorial gain and subjugation. 

Wars without international legality (i.e. not out of self-defense nor sanctioned by the [[United Nations Security Council]]) can be considered wars of aggression; however, this alone usually does not constitute the definition of a war of aggression&lt;!-- IMHO, the next phrase cancels this by justifying the modern viewpoint: {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

In the judgment of the [[Nuremberg Trials|International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg]], which followed [[World War II]], "War is essentially an evil thing. Its consequences are not confined to the belligerent states alone, but affect the whole world. To initiate a war of aggression, therefore, is not only an international crime; it is the supreme international crime differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole."&lt;ref name="judgment"&gt;{{citation | title=Judgment of the International Military Tribunal for the Trial of German Major War Criminals: The Nazi Regime in Germany |url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/imt/judnazi.asp#common |author=The International Military Tribunal for Germany |date=1946-09-30 |publisher=The Avalon Project, Yale University}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Broomhall|first=Bruce |title=International justice and the International Criminal Court |publisher=Oxford University Press|edition=2|pages=46|isbn= 978-0-19-925600-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-Ni6Qy2E9KwC&amp;pg=PA46 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Article 39 of the [[United Nations Charter]] provides that the UN Security Council shall determine the existence of any act of aggression and "shall make recommendations, or decide what measures shall be taken in accordance with Articles 41 and 42, to maintain or restore international peace and security".

The [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]] refers to the [[crime of aggression]] as one of the "most serious crimes of concern to the international community", and provides that the crime falls within the jurisdiction of the [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC). However, the Rome Statute stipulates that the ICC may not exercise its jurisdiction over the crime of aggression until such time as the states parties agree on a definition of the crime and set out the conditions under which it may be prosecuted. At the [[Review Conference of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Kampala Review Conference]] on 11 June 2010, a total of 111 [[States parties to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|State Parties to the Court]] agreed by [[Consensus decision-making|consensus]] to adopt a [[Resolution (law)|resolution]] accepting the definition of the crime and the conditions for the exercise of [[jurisdiction]] over this crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/asp_docs/Resolutions/RC-Res.6-ENG.pdf|title=Resolution RC/Res.6 !|accessdate=14 May 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320072358/http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/asp_docs/Resolutions/RC-Res.6-ENG.pdf|archivedate=20 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relevant amendments to the Statute, however has not been entered into force yet as of May 14, 2012.

Possibly the first trial for waging aggressive war is that of the Sicilian king [[Conradin]] in 1268.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An introduction to international criminal law and procedure|last=Cryer |display-authors=etal|first=Robert|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-521-13581-8|edition=2nd|location=Cambridge [UK]|pages=312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase is distinctly modern and diametrically opposed to the prior legal international standard of "[[might makes right]]", under the medieval and pre-historic beliefs of [[right of conquest]]. Since the [[Korean War]] of the early 1950s, waging such a [[war]] of aggression is a crime under the [[customary international law]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}.

The origin of the concept, Maguire argues, emerged from the debate on [[Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles]] of 1919: "Germany accepts the responsibility of Germany and her allies for causing all the loss and damage to which the Allied and Associated Governments and their nationals have been subjected as a consequence of the war imposed upon them by the aggression of Germany and her allies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen C.

===The Convention for the Definition of Aggression===
Two '''Conventions for the Definition of Aggression''' were signed in [[London]] on 3 and 4 July 1933. The first was signed by [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|Soviet Union]], [[Turkey]] and [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], and came into effect on 17 February 1934, when it was ratified by all of them but Turkey. The second was signed by [[Kingdom of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]] (ratified 20 October 1933), [[Estonia]] (4 December), [[Latvia]] (4 December), [[Persia]] (16 November), [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] (16 October), Romania (16 October), the Soviet Union (16 October) and Turkey, which ratified both treaties on 23 March 1934. [[Finland]] acceded to the second convention on 31 January 1934. The second convention was the first to be registered with the [[League of Nations Treaty Series]] on 29 March 1934, while the first was registered on 26 April. As [[Lithuania]] refused to sign any treaty including Poland,&lt;ref&gt;Lithuanian authorities regarded Polish rule over the [[Vilnius Region]] as a military occupation of its constitutional capital.&lt;/ref&gt; she signed the definition of aggression in a separate pact with the Soviet Union on 5 July 1933, also in London, and exchanged ratifications on 14 December. It was registered in the Treaty Series on 16 April 1934.

The signatories of both treaties were also signatories of the [[Kellogg–Briand Pact]] prohibiting aggression, and were seeking an agreed definition of the latter. Czechoslovakia, Romania and Yugoslavia were members of the [[Little Entente]], and their signatures alarmed [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], since the definition of aggression clearly covered its support of the [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;S. A. H., "Bulgaria and the Balkan Entente", ''Bulletin of International News'', 15, 16 (1938), 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Both treaties base their definition on the "Politis Report" of the Committee of Security Questions made 24 March 1933 to the Conference for the Reduction and Limitation of Armaments, in answer to a proposal of the Soviet delegation. The Greek politician [[Nikolaos Politis]] was behind the inclusion of "support for armed bands" as a form of aggression.&lt;ref&gt;Leon Romaniecki, "The Soviet Union and International Terrorism", ''Soviet Studies'', 26, 3 (1974), 420.&lt;/ref&gt; Ratifications for both treaties were deposited in [[Moscow]], as the convention was primarily the work of [[Maxim Litvinov]], the Soviet signatory.&lt;ref&gt;P. Zadeikis, "An Aspect of the Lithuanian Record of Independence", ''Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science'', 232 (1944), 50.&lt;/ref&gt; The convention defined an act of aggression as follows:
* Declaration of war upon another State.
* Invasion by its armed forces, with or without a declaration of war, of the territory of another State.
* Attack by its land, naval or air forces, with or without a declaration of war, on the territory, vessels or aircraft of another State.
* Naval blockade of the coasts or ports of another State.
* Provision of support to armed bands formed in its territory which have invaded the territory of another State, or refusal, notwithstanding the request of the invaded State, to take, in its own territory, all the measures in its power to deprive those bands of all assistance or protection.

The League prerogative under that convention to expel a League member found guilty of aggression was used by the League Assembly only once, against the Soviet government itself, on December 14, 1939, following the Soviet invasion of Finland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.histdoc.net/history/league1.html League of Nations Assembly resolution of December 14, 1939, expelling the Soviet government]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.histdoc.net/history/league2.html League of Nations Council resolution of December 14, 1939, expelling the Soviet government]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Nuremberg Principles===

In 1945, the [[London Charter of the International Military Tribunal]] defined three categories of crimes, including ''[[crimes against peace]]''. This definition was first used by [[Finland]] to prosecute the political leadership in the [[war-responsibility trials in Finland]]. The principles were later known as the [[Nuremberg Principles]].

In 1950, the [[Nuremberg Trials|Nuremberg Tribunal]] defined [[Crimes against peace|Crimes against Peace]], in [[Nuremberg Principles#Principle VI|Principle VI]], specifically Principle VI(a), submitted to the [[United Nations General Assembly]], as:&lt;ref name="emlyn"&gt;[http://www.emlyn.org.uk/stopwar/rmanson/review/digest.shtml "Skeleton Argument for High Court Judicial Review"]. Emlyn.org.uk, 2006. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080702012835/http://www.emlyn.org.uk/stopwar/rmanson/review/digest.shtml |date=2008-07-02 }}.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Trid"&gt;[http://www.tridentploughshares.org/article1079 "Tri-denting It Handbook, 3rd Ed (2001) – Part 6"], Trident Ploughshares, Norwich NR2 1NR, 2001.
{{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070925104337/http://www.tridentploughshares.org/article1079 |date=2007-09-25 }}.
&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|{{ordered list|list_style_type=lower-roman
| Planning, preparation, initiation or waging of a war of aggression or a war in violation of international treaties, agreements or assurances;
| Participation in a common plan or conspiracy for the accomplishment of any of the acts mentioned under (i).}}}}

See: ''[[Nuremberg Trials]]:'' "The legal basis for the jurisdiction of the court was that defined by the Instrument of Surrender of Germany, political authority for Germany had been transferred to the Allied Control Council, which having sovereign power over Germany could choose to punish violations of international law and the laws of war. Because the court was limited to violations of the laws of war, it did not have jurisdiction over crimes that took place before the outbreak of war on September 1, 1939."

For committing this crime, the Nuremberg Tribunal sentenced a number of persons responsible for starting [[World War II]]. One consequence of this is that nations who are starting an armed conflict must now argue that they are either exercising the right of self-defense, the right of collective defense, or – it seems – the enforcement of the [[criminal law]] of ''[[jus cogens]]''. It has made formal [[declaration of war]] uncommon after 1945.

Reading the Tribunal's final judgment in court, British alternate judge [[Norman Birkett, 1st Baron Birkett|Norman Birkett]] said:

{{quote|The charges in the Indictment that the defendants planned and waged aggressive wars are charges of the utmost gravity. War is essentially an evil thing. Its consequences are not confined to the belligerent states alone, but affect the whole world.

To initiate a war of aggression, therefore, is not only an international crime; it is the supreme international crime differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole.&lt;ref name="judgment"/&gt;}}

Associate Supreme Court Justice [[William O. Douglas]] charged that the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] were guilty of "substituting power for principle" at Nuremberg. "I thought at the time and still think that the Nuremberg trials were unprincipled," he wrote. "[[ex post facto law|Law was created ex post facto]] to suit the passion and clamor of the time."&lt;ref&gt;''Dönitz at Nuremberg: A Reappraisal'', H. K. Thompson, Jr. and Henry Strutz, (Torrance, Calif.: 1983).&lt;/ref&gt;

===The United Nations Charter===
The relevant provisions of the [[Charter of the United Nations]] mentioned in the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|RSICC]] article 5.2 were framed to include the Nuremberg Principles. The specific principle is ''[[Nuremberg Principles#Principle VI|Principle VI]].a'' "[[Crimes against peace]]", which was based on the provisions of the [[London Charter of the International Military Tribunal]] that was issued in 1945 and formed the basis for the post [[World War II]] war crime trials. The Charters provisions based on the Nuremberg Principle VI.a are:

{{quote|
* '''Article 1''':
**The Purposes of the [[United Nations]] are:
**#To maintain international peace and security, and to that end: to take effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the [[peace]], and for the suppression of acts of aggression or other breaches of the peace, and to bring about by peaceful means, and in conformity with the principles of [[justice]] and [[international law]], adjustment or settlement of international disputes or situations which might lead to a [[breach of the peace]];
**#To develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of [[Civil rights|equal rights]] and [[self-determination]] of [[peoples]], and to take other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace;
* '''Article 2, paragraph 4'''
**All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations.
* '''Article 33'''
**The parties to any dispute, the continuance of which is likely to endanger the maintenance of international peace and security, shall, first of all, seek a solution by negotiation, enquiry, mediation, conciliation, arbitration, judicial settlement, resort to regional agencies or arrangements, or other peaceful means of their own choice.
**The [[Security Council]] shall, when it deems necessary, call upon the parties to settle their dispute by such means.
* '''Article 39'''
**The Security Council shall determine the existence of any threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression and shall make recommendations, or decide what measures shall be taken in accordance with Articles 41 and 42, to maintain or restore international peace and security.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/aboutun/charter/index.html United Nations Charter]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===The Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance (Rio Pact)===
The [[Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance]], signed in Rio de Janeiro on September 2, 1947, included a clear definition of aggression. Article 9 stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In addition to other acts which the Organ of Consultation may characterize as aggression, the following shall be considered as such:{{ordered list|list_style_type=lower-alpha
| Unprovoked armed attack by a State against the territory, the people, or the land, sea or air forces of another State;
| Invasion, by the armed forces of a State, of the territory of an American State, through the trespassing of boundaries demarcated in accordance with a treaty, judicial decision, or arbitral award, or, in the absence of frontiers thus demarcated, invasion affecting a region which is under the effective jurisdiction of another State.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oas.org/juridico/english/Treaties/b-29.html The Rio Pact]&lt;/ref&gt;}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Further discussions on defining aggression===
The discussions on definition of aggression under the UN began in 1950, following the outbreak of the [[Korean War]]. As the western governments, headed by Washington, were in favor of defining the governments of North Korea and the People's Republic of China as aggressor states, the Soviet government proposed to formulate a new UN resolution defining aggression and based on the 1933 convention. As a result, on November 17, 1950, the General Assembly passed resolution 378, &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.refworld.org/docid/3b00f1ed5c.html UN General Assembly Resolution 378 (V) on the Duties of States in the Event of the Outbreak of Hostilities]&lt;/ref&gt; which referred the issue to be defined by the [[International Law Commission]]. The commission deliberated over this issue in its 1951 session and due to large disagreements among its members, decided "that the only practical course was to aim at a general and abstract definition (of aggression)".&lt;ref&gt;[http://legal.un.org/ilc/publications/yearbooks/english/ilc_1951_v2.pdf ''Yearbook of the ILC 1951'', vol. 2], p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; However, a tentative definition of aggression was adopted by the commission on June 4, 1951, which stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Aggression is the use of force by a State or Government against another State or Government, in any manner, whatever the weapons used and whether openly or otherwise, for any reason or for any purpose other than individual or collective self-defence or in pursuance of a decision or recommendation by a competent organ of the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;UN Doc. A/CN.4/L.13, in [http://legal.un.org/ilc/publications/yearbooks/english/ilc_1951_v1.pdf ''Yearbook of the ILC 1951'', vol. 1], p. 116, fn. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===General Assembly Resolution 3314===
On December 14, 1974, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] adopted [[Resolution 3314]], which defined the crime of aggression. This definition is not binding as such under international law, though it may reflect [[customary international law]].

This definition makes a distinction between ''aggression'' (which "gives rise to international responsibility") and ''war of aggression'' (which is "a crime against international peace"). Acts of aggression are defined as armed invasions or attacks, bombardments, blockades, armed violations of territory, permitting other states to use one's own territory to perpetrate acts of aggression and the employment of armed irregulars or mercenaries to carry out acts of aggression. A war of aggression is a series of acts committed with a sustained intent. The definition's distinction between an ''act'' of aggression and a ''war'' of aggression make it clear that not every act of aggression would constitute a crime against peace; only war of aggression does. States would nonetheless be held responsible for acts of aggression.

The wording of the definition has been criticised by many commentators. Its clauses on the use of armed irregulars are notably vague, as it is unclear what level of "involvement" would entail state responsibility. It is also highly state-centric, in that it deems states to be the only actors liable for acts of aggression. Domestic or transnational insurgent groups, such as those that took part in the [[Sierra Leone Civil War]] and the [[Yugoslav Wars]], were key players in their respective conflicts despite being non-state parties; they would not have come within the scope of the definition.

The Definition of Aggression also does not cover acts by international organisations. The two key military alliances at the time of the definition's adoption, [[NATO]] and the [[Warsaw Pact]], were non-state parties and thus were outside the scope of the definition.&lt;ref&gt;Ingrid Detter Delupis, ''The Law of War'', pp. 69–70. Cambridge University Press, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the definition does not deal with the responsibilities of individuals for acts of aggression. It is widely perceived as an insufficient basis on which to ground individual criminal prosecutions.&lt;ref&gt;L. F. Damrosch, "Enforcing International Law through Non-forcible Measures", p. 202. ''Recueil De Cours/Collected Courses'', Académie de Droit International de La Haye, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

While this Definition of Aggression has often been cited by opponents of conflicts such as the 1999 [[Kosovo War]] and the 2003 [[Iraq War]], it has no binding force in [[international law]]. The doctrine of ''[[Nulla poena sine lege]]'' means that, in the absence of binding international law on the subject of aggression, no penalty exists for committing acts in contravention of the definition. It is only recently that heads of state have been indicted over acts committed in wartime, in the cases of [[Slobodan Milošević]] of [[Serbia]] and [[Charles Taylor (Liberian politician)|Charles Taylor]] of [[Liberia]]. However, both were charged with [[War crime|war crimes]], i.e. violations of the [[Law of war|laws of war]], rather than with the broader offence of "a crime against international peace" as envisaged by the Definition of Aggression.

The definition is not binding on the Security Council. The [[Charter of the United Nations|United Nations Charter]] empowers the General Assembly to make recommendations to the [[United Nations Security Council]] but the Assembly may not dictate to the Council. The resolution accompanying the definition states that it is intended to provide guidance to the Security Council to aid it "in determining, in accordance with the Charter, the existence of an act of aggression".&lt;ref&gt;[[Yoram Dinstein]], ''War, Aggression and Self-Defence'', p. 118. Cambridge University Press, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The Security Council may apply or disregard this guidance as it sees fit. Legal commentators argue that the Definition of Aggression has had "no visible impact" on the deliberations of the Security Council.&lt;ref&gt;M. C. Bassiouni and B. B. Ferencz, "The Crime against Peace", ''International Criminal Law'', I, 313, 334 (M.C. Bassiouni ed., 2nd ed., 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court===
{{Main|Crime of aggression}}

The [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]] lists the crime of aggression as one of the most serious crimes of concern to the international community, and provides that the crime falls within the jurisdiction of the [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC). However, Article 5.2 of the Rome Statute states that "The Court shall exercise jurisdiction over the crime of aggression once a provision is adopted in accordance with articles 121 and 123 defining the crime and setting out the conditions under which the Court shall exercise jurisdiction with respect to this crime. Such a provision shall be consistent with the relevant provisions of the Charter of the United Nations."&lt;ref&gt;[http://legal.un.org/icc/statute/99_corr/2.htm#art.5  Part 2. Jurisdiction, admissibility and applicable law.  Article 5.]&lt;/ref&gt; The Assembly of States Parties of the ICC adopted such a definition in 2010 at the [[Review Conference of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Review Conference]] in [[Kampala]], [[Uganda]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icc-cpi.int/menus/icc/press%20and%20media/press%20releases/review%20conference%20of%20the%20rome%20statute%20concludes%20in%20kampala Review Conference of the Rome Statute concludes in Kampala] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618140234/http://www.icc-cpi.int/menus/icc/press%20and%20media/press%20releases/review%20conference%20of%20the%20rome%20statute%20concludes%20in%20kampala |date=2010-06-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jurist.org/paperchase/2010/06/icc-nations-adopt-crime-of-aggression.php|title=ICC nations define crime of aggression|accessdate= 26 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''war crime''' is an act that constitutes a serious violation of the [[laws of war]] that gives rise to individual criminal responsibility.&lt;ref name="Cassese"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Cassese |first=Antonio |authorlink=Antonio Cassese |title=Cassese's International Criminal Law |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4LSPtqicFUcC |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=2013 |edition=3rd |pages=63–66 |isbn=978-0-19-969492-1 |access-date=October 5, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160429140110/https://books.google.com/books?id=4LSPtqicFUcC |archive-date=April 29, 2016 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of war crimes include [[Crimes against humanity|intentionally killing civilians]] or [[Prisoners of war|prisoners]], [[torturing]], destroying civilian property, taking [[hostage]]s, performing a [[perfidy]], [[Wartime sexual violence|raping]], [[children in the military|using child soldiers]], [[pillaging]], declaring that [[no quarter]] will be given, and seriously violating the principles of [[distinction (law)|distinction]], [[proportionality (law)|proportionality]], and [[military necessity]].

The concept of war crimes emerged at the turn of the twentieth century when the body of [[customary international law]] applicable to warfare between [[sovereign state]]s was codified. Such codification occurred at the national level, such as with the publication of the [[Lieber Code]] in the United States, and at the international level with the adoption of the treaties during the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907]]. Moreover, trials in national courts during this period further helped clarify the law.&lt;ref name="Cassese"/&gt; Following the end of [[World War II]], major developments in the law occurred. Numerous trials of [[Axis powers|Axis]] war criminals established the [[Nuremberg principles]], such as notion that war crimes constituted [[International criminal law|crimes defined by international law]]. Additionally, the [[Geneva Conventions]] in 1949 defined new war crimes and established that states could exercise [[universal jurisdiction]] over such crimes.&lt;ref name="Cassese"/&gt; In the late 20th century and early 21st century, following the creation of several [[international court]]s, additional categories of war crimes applicable to armed conflicts other than those between states, such as [[civil war]]s, were defined.&lt;ref name="Cassese"/&gt;

===Hague Conventions===
{{Main|Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)}}

The Hague Conventions were international treaties negotiated at the First and Second Peace Conferences at [[The Hague]], Netherlands, in 1899 and 1907, respectively, and were, along with the Geneva Conventions, among the first formal statements of the [[laws of war]] and war crimes in the nascent body of secular [[international law]].

===Geneva Conventions===
{{Main|Geneva Conventions}}

The [[Geneva Conventions]] are four related treaties adopted and continuously expanded from 1864 to 1949 that represent a legal basis and framework for the conduct of war under international law. Every single member state of the United Nations has currently ratified the conventions, which are universally accepted as [[customary international law]], applicable to every situation of armed conflict in the world. However, the Additional Protocols to the Geneva Conventions adopted in 1977 containing the most pertinent, detailed and comprehensive protections of [[international humanitarian law]] for persons and objects in modern warfare are still not ratified by a number of States continuously engaged in armed conflicts, namely the United States, Israel, India, Pakistan, Iraq, Iran, and others. Accordingly, states retain different codes and values with regard to wartime conduct. Some signatories have routinely violated the Geneva Conventions in a way which either uses the ambiguities of law or political maneuvering to sidestep the laws' formalities and principles.

Three conventions were revised and expanded with the fourth one added in 1949:
* [[First Geneva Convention]] ''for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field'' (Convention ''for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field'' was adopted in 1864, significantly revised and replaced by the 1906 version,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icrc.org/applic/ihl/ihl.nsf/INTRO/180?OpenDocument |title=Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armies in the Field.

* [[Third Geneva Convention]] ''relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War'' ([[Geneva Convention (1929)|Convention ''relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War'' was adopted in 1929]], significantly revised and replaced by the Third Geneva Convention of 1949).[[File:Destroyed house in the south of Sanaa 12-6-2015-3.jpg|thumb|[[Human Rights Watch|HRW]] wrote that the [[Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen|Saudi Arabian-led military intervention in Yemen]] that began on March 26, 2015 had conducted airstrikes in apparent violation of the laws of war.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.dw.com/en/human-rights-watch-saudi-stikes-in-yemen-violated-international-law/a-18554746 Human Rights Watch: Saudi strikes in Yemen violated international law] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150722074552/http://www.dw.com/en/human-rights-watch-saudi-stikes-in-yemen-violated-international-law/a-18554746 |date=July 22, 2015 }}".

* [[Fourth Geneva Convention]] ''relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War'' (first adopted in 1949, based on parts of the 1907 [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|Hague Convention IV]]).

Two Additional Protocols were adopted in 1977 with the third one added in 2005, completing and updating the Geneva Conventions:
* [[Protocol I]] (1977) ''relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts.''
* [[Protocol II]] (1977) ''relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflicts.''
* [[Protocol III]] (2005) ''relating to the Adoption of an Additional Distinctive Emblem.''

===Leipzig War Crimes Trial===
{{Main|Leipzig War Crimes Trials}}
A small number of German military personnel of the [[First World War]] were tried in 1921 by the German Supreme Court for alleged war crimes.

=== London Charter / Nuremberg Trials 1945 ===
{{Main|London Charter of the International Military Tribunal|Nuremberg Trials}}
The modern concept of war crime was further developed under the auspices of the [[Nuremberg Trials]] based on the definition in the [[London Charter of the International Military Tribunal|London Charter]] that was published on August 8, 1945. (Also see [[Nuremberg Principles]].) Along with war crimes the charter also defined crimes against peace and crimes against humanity, which are often committed during wars and in concert with war crimes.

=== International Military Tribunal for the Far East 1946 ===
{{Main|International Military Tribunal for the Far East}}

Also known as the Tokyo Trial, the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal or simply as the Tribunal, it was convened on May 3, 1946 to try the leaders of the Empire of Japan for three types of crimes: "Class A" (crimes against peace), "Class B" (war crimes), and "Class C" (crimes against humanity), committed during [[World War II]].

=== International Criminal Court 2002 ===
[[File:My Lai massacre.jpg|thumb|Bodies of some of the hundreds of Vietnamese villagers who were killed by U.S. soldiers during the [[My Lai Massacre]].]]
On July 1, 2002, the [[International Criminal Court]], a treaty-based court located in [[The Hague]], came into being for the prosecution of war crimes committed on or after that date.  Several nations, most notably the United States, China, Russia, and Israel, have criticized the court. The United States still participates as an observer. Article 12 of the Rome Statute provides jurisdiction over the citizens of non-contracting states in the event that they are accused of committing crimes in the territory of one of the state parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, 1998|url=http://legal.un.org/icc/STATUTE/99_corr/cstatute.htm|publisher=UN Treaty Organization|accessdate=October 13, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019222421/http://legal.un.org/icc/statute/99_corr/cstatute.htm|archive-date=October 19, 2013|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

War crimes are defined in the statute that established the International Criminal Court, which includes:
# Grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions, such as:
## Willful killing, or causing great suffering or serious injury to body or health
## [[Torture]] or inhumane treatment
## Unlawful wanton destruction or appropriation of property
## Forcing a [[prisoner of war]] to serve in the forces of a hostile power
## Depriving a prisoner of war of a [[fair trial]]
## Unlawful [[deportation]], confinement or [[population transfer|transfer]]
## Taking [[hostage]]s
## Directing attacks against civilians[[File:Prisoners on ground before execution,Taejon, South Korea.jpg|thumb|[[Bodo League massacre]] during the Korean War in 1950]]
## Directing attacks against humanitarian workers or UN [[Peacekeeping|peacekeeper]]s
## [[No quarter|Killing a surrendered combatant]]
## Misusing a flag of truce
## Settlement of occupied territory
## Deportation of inhabitants of occupied territory
## Using poison weapons
## Using civilians as shields
## Using [[Military use of children|child soldiers]]
## Firing upon a [[Combat Medic]] with clear insignia.
# The following acts as part of a non-international conflict:
## Murder, cruel or degrading treatment and torture
## Directing attacks against civilians, humanitarian workers or UN peacekeepers
# The following acts as part of an international conflict:[[File:Lugansk-2014-06-18.jpeg|thumb|Civilians killed in shelling in eastern [[Ukraine]].

## Taking hostages
## Summary execution
## [[Looting|Pillage]]
## Rape, [[sexual slavery]], forced prostitution or forced pregnancy

However the court only has jurisdiction over these crimes where they are "''part of a plan or policy or as part of a large-scale commission of such crimes''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://legal.un.org/icc/statute/romefra.htm |title=Rome Statute, Part II, Article 8 |publisher=[[United Nations Office of Legal Affairs]] |accessdate=October 18, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019222329/http://legal.un.org/icc/statute/romefra.htm |archive-date=October 19, 2013 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

War crimes are serious violations of the rules of customary and treaty law concerning [[international humanitarian law]] that have become accepted as criminal offenses for which there is individual responsibility.&lt;ref name="Shaw"&gt;{{cite book|last=Shaw|first=M.N|title=International Law|year=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-89929-1|pages=433–434|url=http://www.cambridge.org/978052189929}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Colloquial definitions of ''war crime'' include violations of established protections of the ''laws of war'', but also include failures to adhere to norms of procedure and rules of battle, such as attacking those displaying a peaceful [[flag of truce]], or using that same flag as a ruse to mount an attack on enemy troops. The use of [[chemical weapon|chemical]] and [[Biological agent|biological weapons]] in warfare are also prohibited by [[List of chemical arms control agreements|numerous chemical arms control agreements]] and the [[Biological Weapons Convention]]. Wearing enemy uniforms or civilian clothes to infiltrate enemy lines for [[espionage]] or [[sabotage]] missions is a legitimate [[ruse of war]], though fighting in [[combat]] or [[assassinations|assassinating]] individuals behind enemy lines while so disguised is not, as it constitutes unlawful [[perfidy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Smith | first = Michael | authorlink = | title = Killer Elite: The Inside Story of America's Most Secret Special Operations Team | publisher = St. Martin's Press | year = 2007 | location = New York, New York| pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-312-36272-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Delta Force: The Army's Elite Counterterrorist Unit | author = Beckwith, Charlie A. | author2 = Knox, Donald | publisher = Avon | year = 2003 | isbn = 978-0-380-80939-4 | url = https://archive.org/details/deltaforcearmyse00beck }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v2_cou_us_rule65_sectioni| title = United States of America, Practice Relating to Rule 65.

A war crime occurs when superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering is inflicted upon an enemy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Injury profile suffered by targets of antipersonnel improvised explosive devices: prospective cohort study. |journal= BMJ Open |year=2017 |pages=e014697 |volume=7 |issue= 7 |doi=10.1136/bmjopen-2016-014697 |pmid=28835410 |pmc=5691184 | last1 = Smith | first1 = S | last2 = Devine | first2 = M | last3 = Taddeo | first3 = J | last4 = McAlister | first4 = VC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

War crimes also include such acts as mistreatment of [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] or [[civilians]]. War crimes are sometimes part of instances of [[mass murder]] and [[genocide]] though these crimes are more broadly covered under [[international humanitarian law]] described as [[crime against humanity|crimes against humanity]]. In 2008, the [[U.N. Security Council]] adopted [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1820|Resolution 1820]], which noted that "rape and other forms of sexual violence can constitute war crimes, crimes against humanity or a constitutive act with respect to genocide"; see also [[war rape]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2008/sc9364.doc.htm|title=Security Council Demands Immediate and Complete Halt to Acts of Sexual Violence|work=un.org|access-date=June 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140823231218/http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2008/sc9364.doc.htm|archive-date=August 23, 2014|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the [[International Criminal Court]] convicted someone of sexual violence for the first time; specifically, they added rape to a war crimes conviction of Congo Vice President [[Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/international-court-adds-rape-to-war-crimes-list-in-congo-conviction/2016/03/21/2e7f4320-ef72-11e5-85a6-2132cf446d0a_story.html|title=In historic ruling, international court cites rape in war crimes conviction of ex-Congo official|author=Kevin Sieff|date=March 21, 2016|work=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

War crimes also included deliberate attacks on [[citizens]] and [[property]] of [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutral states]], such as the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. As the attack on Pearl Harbor happened while the U.S. and Japan were at peace and without a just cause for self-defense, the attack was declared by the [[Tokyo Trials]] to go beyond justification of [[military necessity]] and therefore constituted a war crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Responding to International Crime (International Studies in Human Rights) |author=Geoff Gilbert|date=September 30, 2006 |page=358 |isbn=978-90-04-15276-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Tokyo War Crimes Trial: The Pursuit of Justice in the Wake of World War II |page=57 |author=Yuma Totani |date=April 1, 2009 |publisher=[[Harvard University Asia Center]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Understanding International Law |pages=210–229|authorlink1=Stephen McCaffrey |author=Stephen C.

War crimes are significant in international humanitarian law&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ihl.ihlresearch.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=page.viewpage&amp;pageid=2083|title=The Program for Humanitarian Policy and Conflict Research, "Brief Primer on IHL"|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100419104833/http://ihl.ihlresearch.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=page.viewpage&amp;pageid=2083|archivedate=April 19, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; because it is an area where international tribunals such as the [[Nuremberg Trials]] and [[Tokyo Trials]] have been convened. Recent examples are the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia|International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia]] and the [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]], which were established by the [[UN Security Council]] acting under Chapter VIII of the [[United Nations Charter|UN Charter]].

Under the [[Nuremberg Principles]], ''war crimes'' are different from [[crimes against peace]].  Crimes against peace include planning, preparing, initiating, or waging a [[war of aggression]], or a war in violation of international treaties, agreements, or assurances.  Because the definition of a state of "war" may be debated, the term "war crime" itself has seen different usage under different systems of international and military law. It has some degree of application outside of what some may consider to be a state of "war", but in areas where conflicts persist enough to constitute social instability.

The legalities of war have sometimes been accused of containing favoritism toward the winners ("[[Victor's justice]]"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zolo|first=Danilo|title=Victors' Justice: From Nuremberg to Baghdad|publisher=Verso|date=November 2, 2009|isbn=978-1-84467-317-9|url=https://archive.org/details/victorsjusticefr00zolo}}&lt;/ref&gt; as some controversies have not been ruled as war crimes. Some examples include the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]' destruction of [[Axis Powers|Axis]] cities during [[World War II]], such as the [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|firebombing of Dresden]], the [[Bombing of Tokyo (10 March 1945)|''Operation Meetinghouse'' raid on Tokyo]] (the most destructive single bombing raid in history), and the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wagingpeace.org/articles/2009/11/03_tanaka_falk_lessons.php |title=The Atomic Bombing, The Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal and the Shimoda Case: Lessons for Anti-Nuclear Legal Movements by Yuki Tanaka and Richard Falk |publisher=Wagingpeace.org |accessdate=May 2, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318152421/http://www.wagingpeace.org/articles/2009/11/03_tanaka_falk_lessons.php |archive-date=March 18, 2012 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In regard to the [[strategic bombing during World War II]], there was no international treaty or instrument protecting a civilian population specifically from attack by aircraft,&lt;ref name="Gomez"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Law of Air Warfare |journal=International Review of the Red Cross |number=323 |pages=347–363 |date=June 30, 1998 |url=https://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/article/other/57jpcl.htm |accessdate=June 21, 2013 |author=Javier Guisández Gómez |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403063004/http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/article/other/57jpcl.htm |archive-date=April 3, 2013 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; therefore the aerial attacks on civilians were not officially war crimes. The Allies at the trials in [[Nuremberg]] and [[Tokyo]] never prosecuted the Germans, including [[Luftwaffe]] commander-in-chief [[Hermann Göring]], for the bombing raids on [[Bombing of Warsaw in World War II|Warsaw]], [[Rotterdam Blitz|Rotterdam]], and British cities during [[the Blitz]] as well as the indiscriminate attacks on Allied cities with [[V-1 flying bomb]]s and [[V-2 rocket]]s, nor the Japanese for the aerial attacks on crowded Chinese cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Terror from the Sky: The Bombing of German Cities in World War II |year=2010 |page=167 |publisher=[[Berghahn Books]] |isbn=978-1-84545-844-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there are no treaties specific to aerial warfare,&lt;ref name="Gomez"/&gt; Protocol 1, Article 51 of the Geneva Conventions explicitly prohibits the bombardment of cities where civilian population might be concentrated regardless of any method.&lt;ref name="Protocol"/&gt; (see [[Aerial bombardment and international law]]).

Controversy arose when the Allies re-designated German [[POW]]s (under the protection of the [[Geneva Convention (1929)|1929 Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War]]) as [[Disarmed Enemy Forces]] (allegedly unprotected by the 1929 Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War), many of which then were used for [[forced labor]] such as clearing [[Land mine|minefields]].&lt;ref name="Modern History 1994 pp. 487"&gt;S.

(Sep. 1994), pp. 487–520.&lt;/ref&gt; By December 1945, six months after the war had ended, it was estimated by French authorities that 2,000 German prisoners were still being killed or maimed each month in mine-clearing accidents.&lt;ref name="Modern History 1994 pp. 487"/&gt; The wording of the 1949 [[Third Geneva Convention]] was intentionally altered from that of the 1929 convention so that soldiers who "fall into the power" following surrender or mass capitulation of an enemy are now protected as well as those taken prisoner in the course of fighting.&lt;ref&gt;[[International Committee of the Red Cross|ICRC]] [http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/WebList?ReadForm&amp;id=375&amp;t=com Commentaries on the Convention (III) relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130404232221/http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/WebList?ReadForm&amp;id=375&amp;t=com |date=April 4, 2013 }} [http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/COM/375-590008?OpenDocument Article 5] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023025704/http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/COM/375-590008?OpenDocument |date=October 23, 2013 }} "One category of military personnel which was refused the advantages of the Convention in the course of the Second World War comprised German and Japanese troops who fell into enemy hands on the capitulation of their countries in 1945 (6). The German capitulation was both political, involving the dissolution of the Government, and military, whereas the Japanese capitulation was only military. Moreover, the situation was different since Germany was a party to the 1929 Convention and Japan was not. Nevertheless, the German and Japanese troops were considered as surrendered enemy personnel and were deprived of the protection provided by the 1929 Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[International Committee of the Red Cross|ICRC]] [http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/WebList?ReadForm&amp;id=375&amp;t=com Commentaries on the Convention (III) relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130404232221/http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/WebList?ReadForm&amp;id=375&amp;t=com |date=April 4, 2013 }} [http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/COM/375-590008?OpenDocument Article 5] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023025704/http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/COM/375-590008?OpenDocument |date=October 23, 2013 }} "Under the present provision, the Convention applies to persons who "fall into the power" of the enemy. This term is also used in the opening sentence of Article 4, replacing the expression "captured" which was used in the 1929 Convention (Article 1). It indicates clearly that the treatment laid down by the Convention is applicable not only to military personnel taken prisoner in the course of fighting, but also to those who fall into the hands of the adversary following surrender or mass capitulation."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legality of Civilian Casualties ==
Under the [[Law of Armed Conflict|Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC)]], the death of non-combatants isn't necessarily a violation, there are many things to take into account. Civilians ''cannot'' be made the object of an attack, but the death/injury of civilians while conducting an attack on a military objective are governed under principles such as of proportionality and [[military necessity]] and can be permissible. Military necessity "permits the destruction of life of … persons whose destruction is incidentally unavoidable by the armed conflicts of the war; ... it does not permit the killing of innocent inhabitants for purposes of revenge or the satisfaction of a lust to kill. The destruction of property to be lawful must be imperatively demanded by the necessities of war"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Trials of war criminals before the Nuernberg Military Tribunals under Control Council law no. 10, Nuremberg, October 1946-April, 1949.|last=Germany (Territory under Allied occupation, 1945–1955 : U.S. Zone)|date=1997|publisher=William S. Hein|isbn=1575882159|oclc=37718851}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, conducting an operation on ammunition depot or a terrorist training camp would not be prohibited because a farmer is plowing a field in the area, the farmer is not the object of attack and the operations would adhere to proportionality and military necessity. On the other hand, an extraordinary military advantage would be necessary to justify an operation posing risks of collateral death or injury to thousands of civilians. In "grayer cases" the legal question of whether the expected incidental harm is excessive may be very subjective. For this reason, States have chosen to apply a "clearly excessive" standard for determining whether a criminal violation has occurred.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Department of Defense law of war manual|last=United States. Department of Defense. Office of General Counsel, author.|oclc=953877027}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When there is no justification for military action, such as civilians being made the object of attack, a proportionality analysis is unnecessary to conclude that the attack is unlawful.

=== International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia ===
For aerial strikes, pilots generally have to rely on information supplied external sources (Headquarters, ground troops) that a specific position is in fact a military target. In the case of former [[Yugoslavia]], [[NATO]] pilots hit a civilian object ([[United States bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade]])  that was of no military significance, but the pilots had no idea of determining it aside from their orders. The committee ruled that "the aircrew involved in the attack should not be assigned any responsibility for the fact they were given the wrong target and that it is inappropriate to attempt to assign criminal responsibility for the incident to senior leaders because they were provided with wrong information by officials of another agency.".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/en/press/final-report-prosecutor-committee-established-review-nato-bombing-campaign-against-federal|title=Final Report to the Prosecutor by the Committee Established to Review the NATO Bombing Campaign Against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|website=International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report also notes that "Much of the material submitted to the OTP consisted of reports that civilians had been killed, often inviting the conclusion to be drawn that crimes had therefore been committed. Collateral casualties to civilians and collateral damage to civilian objects can occur for a variety of reasons." &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Rendulic Rule ===
The Rendulic Rule is a standard by which commanders are judged.

German General [[Lothar Rendulic]] was charged for ordering extensive destruction of civilian buildings and lands while retreating a suspected enemy attack in what is called [[scorched earth]] policy for the military purpose of denying the use of ground for the enemy. He overestimated the perceived risk but argued that [[Hague IV Convention|Hague IV]] authorized the destruction because if it's necessary to war. He was acquitted of that charge.

Under the "Rendulic Rule" persons must assess the military necessity of an action based on the information available to them at that time; they cannot be judged based on information that subsequently comes to light.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The '''Razing of Friesoythe''' took place on 14&amp;nbsp;April 1945 during the [[Western Allied invasion of Germany|Western Allies' invasion of Germany]] towards the end of World War II. The [[4th Canadian (Armoured) Division]] attacked the German-held town of [[Friesoythe]] and one of its [[battalion]]s, [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada (Princess Louise's)|The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada]], captured it.

During the fighting the battalion's commander was killed by a German soldier, but it was incorrectly rumoured that he had been killed by a civilian. Under this mistaken belief, the division's commander, [[Major General|Major-General]] [[Christopher Vokes]], ordered that the town be razed in [[Reprisal|retaliation]] and it was substantially destroyed. Twenty German civilians died in Friesoythe and the surrounding area during the two days of fighting and its aftermath. Similar, if usually less extreme, events occurred elsewhere in Germany as the Allies advanced in the closing weeks of the war.

The rubble of the town was used to fill craters in local roads to make them passable for the division's tanks and heavy vehicles. A few days earlier, the division had destroyed the centre of [[Sögel]] in another reprisal and also used the rubble to make the roads passable. Little official notice was taken of the incident and the [[Official History of the Canadian Army in the Second World War|Canadian Army official history]] glosses over it. It is covered in the regimental histories of the units involved and several accounts of the campaign. Forty years later, Vokes wrote in his autobiography that he had "no great remorse over the elimination of Friesoythe".

==Context==
===Allied tactics===
By September 1944, the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]] had reached [[Nazi Germany|Germany's]] western border,{{sfn|Ambrose|1997|p=117}} and by the end of October had [[Battle of Aachen|captured Aachen]], the first major German city to fall to them.{{sfn|Hastings|2004|pp=106–107}} Over the following six months they overran much of western Germany. In November the [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force]] (SHAEF) publicly stated that the forces of the Western Allies would strictly adhere to international law in respect of their treatment of civilians.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=256}} However, SHAEF's manual ''Combating the Guerrilla'' stated that there were circumstances where commanders could take "stern measures" against civilians as a [[reprisal|rapid response]] to guerrilla attacks, although this was in breach of the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Conventions]].{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=256}}

The frequency and nature of retaliatory actions differed between national contingents within the Western Allied forces.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=257}} Following SHAEF's policy, [[United States Army]] forces destroyed German buildings on several occasions, sometimes entire villages, and took other measures against German civilians. French troops took a similar, if more rigorous, approach to that of the Americans.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|pp=258–259}} The British commanders disapproved of retaliations against civilians, and British troops carried out few reprisals.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=257}}

The [[First Canadian Army]] served in the predominately British [[21st Army Group]], and more frequently retaliated against German civilians than the British.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=257}} The commander of [[4th Canadian Division|4th&amp;nbsp;Canadian (Armoured) Division]], Major-General [[Christopher Vokes]], believed that destroying property was the most appropriate way of responding to resistance by German civilians. The division carried out actions against German property more often than any other Canadian formation.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|pp=258–259}}

[[Red Army|Soviet forces]] conducted retaliatory actions than more frequently than their Western Allies. The [[Soviet Union]]'s leadership was concerned about the threat of a [[Werwolf|German resistance movement]], and Soviet forces killed, raped and imprisoned large numbers of local civilians and destroyed property following guerrilla attacks.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|pp=268–270}}

===Allied attitudes===

The attitude towards the Germans throughout the Allied ranks was harsh. There was frustration at their continued resistance in a clearly hopeless cause, anger at the casualties they inflicted when the war was widely, and correctly, perceived to be almost over, and a general feeling that severe, even ruthless, treatment of German soldiers and civilians was justified.{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=597}} On 15&amp;nbsp;April the British reached [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp]], where the inmates had been reduced to cannibalism.{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=599}} The historian [[Rick Atkinson]] wrote that "the revelations of April&amp;nbsp;... sparked enduring outrage".{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=604}}

This was the case at all levels. An American officer wrote "The attitude of higher command seemed to be that these people&amp;nbsp;... should be made to feel the full significance of war and what their troops had done to other people."{{sfn|Hastings|2004|pp=493–494}} The US general [[George Patton]] wrote in his diary "In hundreds of villages&amp;nbsp;... most of the houses are heaps of stone&amp;nbsp;... I did most of it." When a [[sniper]] fired at one of his officers, he ordered several German houses to be burnt.{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=568}} When the commander of US [[3rd Armored Division (United States)|3rd Armored Division]] was killed in action {{convert|150|mi|km|disp=flip}} inside Germany on 30&amp;nbsp;March, several villages were razed by his irate troops, captured wounded Germans were shot on the spot and at least 45&amp;nbsp;Germans were executed after surrendering.{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|pp=581–582}} An artillery officer wrote home in April "we should fire about a thousand rounds into every [German] town. Do them good".{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=598}} At least one British battalion refused to take [[Waffen-SS]] prisoners, shooting those who surrendered; an officer of the battalion blamed this on SS "truculence".{{sfn|Hastings|2004|p=499}} A British battalion commander summed up the risk-averse attitude within his unit: "At this stage of the war, no one was very keen to earn medals."{{sfn|Hastings|2004|p=492}} A British pilot wrote: "It seemed a stupid time to die."{{sfn|Hastings|2004|p=492}} A British [[corporal]] spoke for many when he wrote "Why don't the silly bastards give up?"{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=597}} Some divisions had suffered their last fatality by mid-April.{{sfn|Hastings|2004|p=500}} The historian [[Max Hastings]] wrote "The final Anglo-American drive across Germany offered ... many foolish little battles which wasted men's lives".{{sfn|Hastings|2004|p=491}}

===Battle for Sögel===
[[File:Moncel and Vokes.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|right|alt=Major-General Christopher Vokes in discussion with Brigadier Robert Moncel standing in a street in Sögel on 10&amp;nbsp;April 1945|{{center|Major-General [[Christopher Vokes]] (right) with Brigadier [[Robert Moncel]] at Sögel on 10 April 1945.}}]]
In early April 1945 the 4th&amp;nbsp;Canadian (Armoured) Division, as part of [[II&amp;nbsp;Canadian Corps]], moved out of the eastern Netherlands in the wake of the Allied crossing of the [[Rhine]] in [[Operation Plunder]]. The Canadian official history describes the circumstances as buoyant as it was recognized that the end of World War II in Europe was close.{{sfn|Stacey|1960|p=527}} On 4&amp;nbsp;April, [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada (Princess Louise's)|The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada]], part of the [[10th&amp;nbsp;Canadian Infantry Brigade]], one of two [[brigades]] in the division,{{#tag:ref|The other battalions in the brigade were: [[The Lincoln and Welland Regiment]]; and [[The Algonquin Regiment]].{{sfn|Canadian Soldier|2019}}|group=Note}} made an assault crossing of the [[Ems (river)|Ems]] river and captured the town of [[Meppen]], suffering only one casualty. German prisoners included several 17-year-old youths with less than eight weeks of military experience.{{sfn|Stacey|1960|p=557}}

The division advanced a further {{convert|25|km}} to Sögel, which the 1st&amp;nbsp;Battalion of [[Lake Superior Regiment|The Lake Superior Regiment (Motor)]]{{#tag:ref|The Lake Superior Regiment (Motor) was part of [[4th Canadian Armoured Brigade]] which also included: 21st Armoured Regiment ([[The Governor General's Foot Guards]]); 22nd&amp;nbsp;Armoured Regiment ([[The Canadian Grenadier Guards]]); and 28th&amp;nbsp;Armoured Regiment ([[The British Columbia Regiment]]).{{sfn|Canadian Soldier|2019}}|group=Note}} captured on 9&amp;nbsp;April. The following day it repulsed several German counter-attacks before the town was declared cleared.{{sfn|Williams|1988|p=276}}{{sfn|Stacey|1960|p=558}} Some German civilians joined the fighting and were believed to have killed several Canadian soldiers. Vokes, believing the civilians needed to be taught a lesson, ordered the destruction of the centre of the town.{{sfn|Morton|2016|}} This was accomplished with several truckloads of dynamite. Vokes was aware that these actions violated the Hague Conventions and took care not to issue written instructions.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|pp=258–259}} Soldiers of the division started referring to Vokes as "The Sod of Sögel".{{sfn|Foster|2000|page=437}} The Canadian Army official history states: {{quote|Investigation established that German civilians had taken part in this fighting and had been responsible for the loss of Canadian lives. Accordingly, as a [[reprisal]] and a warning, several houses in the centre of Sögel were ordered destroyed by the engineers to provide rubble.{{sfn|Stacey|1960|p=558}}}}

==Battle for Friesoythe==

The Canadian advance continued across the [[Westphalian Lowland]], reaching the outskirts of Friesoythe, a strategic crossroads, on 13&amp;nbsp;April. As it was early spring, the ground was sodden and heavy vehicles could not operate off the main roads.{{sfn|Stacey|1960|p=558}} This made Friesoythe, {{convert|20|mi|km|disp=flip}} west of [[Oldenburg]], on the River [[Soeste]], a potential bottleneck. If the Germans were to hold it, the bulk of the Canadians would be unable to continue their advance.{{sfn|Zuehlke|2010|page=305}} Most of the population of 4,000 had evacuated to the countryside on 11–12 April.{{#tag:ref|The Friesoythe Amtsgericht, or District Court, was closed on 11&amp;nbsp; April. If the District Court ceased to function on 11&amp;nbsp;April 1945, the evacuation of the bulk of the civilian population probably took place between 11&amp;nbsp;and 12&amp;nbsp;April. This was clearly a German initiative.{{sfn|Cloppenburg|2003|pp=165, 189}}{{sfn|Brockhaus|1996|p=730}}|group=Note}} Several hundred paratroopers from Battalion Raabe of the German [[7th Parachute Division (Germany)|7th&amp;nbsp;Parachute Division]] and anti-tank guns defended the town.{{sfn|Zuehlke|2010|page=305}}{{sfn|Sirluck|1945|}} The paratroopers repelled an attack by the Lake Superior Regiment, which suffered several killed and wounded; German casualties are unknown.{{sfn|Marsh|2015|}}

Vokes ordered the resumption of the attack by the 1st&amp;nbsp;Battalion, The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (Princess Louise's), commanded by [[Lieutenant-colonel (Canada)|Lieutenant-Colonel]] Frederick Wigle. The Argylls conducted a flanking night march and launched a dawn assault on 14&amp;nbsp;April. The attack met only scattered resistance from a disorganized garrison, and the Argylls secured the town by 10:30. During the confused fighting, approximately 50&amp;nbsp;German soldiers{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=257}} caught Wigle's tactical headquarters by surprise at around 08:30. A firefight broke out, resulting in the death of Wigle and several other soldiers. A rumour circulated that a local civilian had shot Wigle.{{sfn|Zuehlke|2010|page=308}}{{sfn|A&amp;SHC archive|1945}}{{sfn|Fraser|1996|p=431}}

===Destruction of Friesoythe===
Vokes was furious when he heard of Wigle's death. He wrote in his autobiography that "a first-rate officer of mine, for whom I had a special regard and affection, and in whom I had a particular professional interest because of his talent for command, was killed. Not merely killed, it was reported to me, but sniped in the back". Vokes wrote, "I summoned my {{Abbr|GSO1|general staff officer}}... 'Mac,' I roared at him, 'I'm going to raze that goddam town. Tell 'em we're going to level the fucking place. Get the people the hell out of their houses first.{{'"}}{{sfn|Foster|2000|page=437}}{{sfn|Vokes|1985|pages=194–195}} Vokes's GSO1 (head of the operations staff), Lieutenant-Colonel Mackenzie Robinson, obeyed but convinced him to not put this order in writing or issue a proclamation to the local civilians.{{sfn|Foster|2000|page=437}}{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|pp=259, 295}} Hastings writes that the earlier incident at Sögel contributed to Vokes's fury.{{sfn|Hastings|2004|p=500}}

The Argylls had spontaneously begun to burn Friesoythe in reprisal for the death of their commander.{{sfn|Fraser|1996|pp=435–437}} After Vokes had issued his order, the town was systematically set on fire with [[flamethrowers]] mounted on [[Universal Carrier|Wasp Carriers]]. In the side streets, soldiers threw petrol containers into buildings and ignited them with [[White phosphorus munitions|phosphorus grenades]]. The attack continued for over eight hours and Friesoythe was almost totally destroyed.{{sfn|Zuehlke|2010|page=308}} As the commanding officer of the 1st&amp;nbsp;Battalion, [[The Algonquin Regiment]] later wrote, "the raging Highlanders cleared the remainder of that town as no town has been cleared for centuries, we venture to say".{{sfn|Cassidy|1948|p=307}} The war diary of the 4th&amp;nbsp;Canadian Armoured Brigade records, "when darkness fell Friesoythe was a reasonable facsimile of Dante's Inferno".{{sfn|Zuehlke|2010|page=309}}

The Canadian official history states that Friesoythe "was set on fire in a mistaken reprisal".{{sfn|Stacey|1960|p=722}} The rubble was used to reinforce the local roads for the division's tanks and heavy transport, which had been unable to move up due to the main roads near the town being badly cratered, and the smaller roads being inadequate to stand their weight.{{sfn|Rogers|1989|p=259}}{{sfn|Granatstein|2010|p=16}}

===Civilian casualties and damage===
During the fighting around Friesoythe and its aftermath, ten civilians from the town and another ten from the surrounding villages were killed.{{sfn|Stadt Friesoythe|2018}} There were reports of civilians lying dead in the streets.{{sfn|Zuehlke|2010|page=308}} According to one German assessment, 85–90 per cent of the town was destroyed during the reprisal.{{sfn|Cloppenburg|2003|p=189}} The {{Lang|de|Brockhaus Enzyklopaedie}} estimates the destruction to have been as high as 90 per cent. The town's website records that of 381{{nbsp}}houses in the town proper, 231{{nbsp}}were destroyed and another 30&amp;nbsp; badly damaged.{{sfn|Stadt Friesoythe|2018}} A few days later, a Canadian nurse wrote home that the [[convent]] on the edge of town was the only building left standing.{{sfn|Hibbert|1985|p=84}} In the suburb of Altenoythe, 120{{nbsp}}houses and 110{{nbsp}}other buildings were destroyed.{{sfn|Stadt Friesoythe|2018}} In 2010, the author Mark Zuehlk suggested that, "Not all of Friesoythe was burnt, but its centre was destroyed".{{sfn|Zuehlke|2010|page=309}}

==Aftermath==

{{Quote box|width=20em|align=left|quote=You should know our soldiers were kind to the children of our enemies, and kind to those in adversity. And they were, on the whole, great ambassadors for Canada.|source=Major-General Christopher Vokes in his autobiography{{sfn|Vokes|1985|p=x}}}}The Argyll's war diary made no mention of their afternoon's activity, noting in passing that "many fires were raging". There is no record of the deliberate destruction at division, corps or army level.{{sfn|Zuehlke|2010|page=309}} The war diary of the division's 8th&amp;nbsp;Anti-Aircraft Regiment records "the Argylls were attacked in that town yesterday by German forces assisted by civilians and today the whole town is being systematically razed. A stern atonement&amp;nbsp;..."{{sfn|Zuehlke|2010|page=309}} The 1st&amp;nbsp;Battalion, The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (Princess Louise's) were awarded the [[battle honour]] "Friesoythe", as were the 1st&amp;nbsp;Battalion, The Lake Superior Regiment (Motor) and the 1st&amp;nbsp;Battalion, The Lincoln and Welland Regiment.{{sfn|Canadian Forces Heritage|2017}}

On 16&amp;nbsp;April The Lincoln and Welland Regiment attacked [[Garrel]], {{convert|10|miles|km|disp=flip}} south-west of Friesoythe. After a German act of [[perfidy]]{{snd}}the mayor surrendered the town but the first tank to enter was destroyed by a [[Panzerfaust]]{{snd}}the battalion commander, Wigle's brother-in-law, ordered that "every building which did not show a white flag be fired".{{sfn|L&amp;WR archive|1945}} Before it could be carried out, the order was countermanded and the village was spared.{{sfn|Zuehlke|2010|page=312}} A Canadian force was also authorized to burn down the village of [[Mittelsten]] following what the historian Perry Briddiscombe calls "an unnamed transgression". They were talked out of this by a Canadian engineer unit as Mittelsten's civilians were running an army sawmill.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=258}}

===Post-war===
In early 1946 Vokes heard an appeal against the death sentence of [[Kurt Meyer]], a convicted German war criminal. Referring to his discussions about this Vokes said to the [[Vincent Massey|Canadian High Commissioner]] in London, "I told them of Sögel and Friesoythe and of the prisoners and civilians that my troops had killed in Italy and Northwest Europe".{{sfn|Foster|2000|page=437}} Vokes [[commutation of sentence|commuted]] the sentence to life imprisonment saying, "There isn't a general or colonel on the Allied side that I know of who hasn't said, 'Well, this time we don't want any prisoners{{'}}".{{sfn|Brode|1997|p=105}}

The Canadian Army official historian, Colonel [[Charles Perry Stacey|Charles Stacey]], visited Friesoythe on 15&amp;nbsp;April. He wrote in the Canadian Army official history, which was published in 1960, that "there is no record of how this [destruction] came about".{{sfn|Zuehlke|2010|p=309}}{{sfn|Stacey|1960|pp=558, 722}} Responding to this, the historian Mark Zuehlke wrote that there were records of the events in the war diaries of several units, but that he did not believe Stacey's vagueness was an attempt at a cover-up.{{sfn|Zuehlke|2010|p=309}} In his 1982 memoirs Stacey expanded upon the official history to comment that the only time he saw what could be considered a [[war crime]] committed by Canadian soldiers{{#tag:ref|The [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|1907 Convention Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land]] (Hague{{nbsp}}IV), Article{{nbsp}}23, prohibits acts that "destroy or seize the enemy's property, unless such destruction or seizure be imperatively demanded by the necessities of war."{{sfn|ICRC|1907}}|group=Note}} was when
{{quote|... at Friesoythe, the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada&amp;nbsp;... lost their popular commanding officer&amp;nbsp;... as a result a great part of the town of Friesoythe was set on fire in a mistaken reprisal. This unfortunate episode only came to my notice and thus got into the pages of history because I was in Friesoythe at the time and saw people being turned out of their houses and the houses burned. How painfully easy it is for the business of "reprisals" to get out of hand!{{sfn|Stacey|1982|pp=163–164}}}}

Vokes commented in his autobiography, written forty years after the event, that he had "[a] feeling of no great remorse over the elimination of Friesoythe. Be that as it may."{{sfn|Morton|2016}}{{sfn|Foster|2000|page=437}} This position may have been motivated by a continued belief that the retaliatory actions were justified.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=295}}

'''Forcing a safeguard''' is a [[war crime]] of violating a [[Safeguard (military)|safeguard]], which is an order to protect a property, locations or persons obtained from the enemy or neutral parties, or a guard or guard detachment to enforce this protection. In the United States, forcing a safeguard is [[Capital punishment by the United States military|punishable by death]] per [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]] (UCMJ).&lt;ref&gt;10 U.S. Code § 902 - Art. 102. Forcing a safeguard. https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/902&lt;/ref&gt;

A safeguard is often placed by a commanding officer in order to prevent [[looting]], pillaging or wanton destruction of enemy property, or to prevent unauthorized requisitioning of goods. The commanding officer can often spare only an individual soldier or a small detachment to enforce the safeguard. Overpowering the guard(s) to loot the goods constitutes forcing a safeguard.&lt;ref name="jordan"&gt;https://www.jordanucmjlaw.com/articles/article-102-forcing-a-safeguard/ Article 102 Forcing a Safeguard&lt;/ref&gt; Another type of safeguard is a written order left with the enemy or his property,&lt;ref name="jordan" /&gt; with the intent to protect surrendered enemies from further violence. By placing the safeguard, the officer pledges the honor of his military to protect its target. Thus, violation of the safeguard by personnel from the same military jeopardizes the reputation of the entire country and its military.&lt;ref name="bilecki"&gt;https://www.bileckilawgroup.com/court-martial-defense/articles-of-the-ucmj/article-102-forcing-a-safeguard/ UCMJ Article 102: Forcing a Safeguard&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conditions ==
In order to be convicted of forcing a safeguard, several conditions must be met:&lt;ref name="jordan" /&gt;
* In the UCMJ, the crime is only applicable if the offender is currently in the military and subject to UCMJ - it does not apply to civilians, neutrals or enemy personnel, or even discharged personnel.
* The safeguard must be placed by a superior officer or commander of the offender's military. The definition does not apply to safeguards left by the enemy or other parties.
* The accused knew or should have known about the existence of the safeguard.
* The accused actually violated the safeguard in a specific manner in a specific time and place, for example by attacking the guard of a property in order to enter the property.

      <text bytes="59143" xml:space="preserve">{{History of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant}}
Deliberate destruction and theft of [[cultural heritage]] has been conducted by the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] since 2014 in [[Iraq]], [[Syria]], and to a lesser extent in [[Libya]]. The destruction targets various places of worship under ISIL control and ancient historical artifacts. In Iraq, between the [[fall of Mosul]] in June 2014 and February 2015, ISIL had plundered and destroyed at least 28 historical religious buildings.&lt;ref name="al-shorfa"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mawtani.al-shorfa.com/en_GB/articles/iii/features/2015/02/13/feature-01 |title=Iraq churches, mosques under ISIS attack |author=Khalid al-Taie |publisher=mawtani.al-shorfa.com |date=13 February 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219092526/http://mawtani.al-shorfa.com/en_GB/articles/iii/features/2015/02/13/feature-01 |archivedate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Valuable items from some buildings were looted in order to smuggle and sell them to foreigners to finance ISIS activities.&lt;ref name="al-shorfa"/&gt; By 23 March 2019, ISIL lost most of its territories in the Middle East, having been defeated in Iraq and Syria.

==Motivation==
{{See also|Aniconism in Islam}}
ISIL justifies the destruction of cultural heritage sites with its following of [[Salafism]] which, according to its followers, places "great importance on establishing [[tawhid]] (monotheism)", and "eliminating [[Shirk (Islam)|shirk]] (polytheism)." While it is often assumed that the group's actions are mindless acts of vandalism, there is an ideological underpinning to the destruction. ISIL views its actions in sites like Palmyra and Nimrud as being in accordance with Sunni [[Islam]]ic tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tonyblairfaithfoundation.org/religion-geopolitics/commentaries/glance/dont-be-surprised-isis-destroying-history |title=Don't Be Surprised by ISIS Destroying History |publisher=Tony Blair Faith Foundation |access-date=2015-09-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803123932/http://tonyblairfaithfoundation.org/religion-geopolitics/commentaries/glance/dont-be-surprised-isis-destroying-history |archive-date=2016-08-03 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond the ideological aspects of the destruction, there are other, more practical, reasons behind ISIL's destruction of historic sites. Grabbing the world's attention is easily done through the destruction of such sites, given the extensive media coverage and international condemnation that comes afterwards. Destroying historic ruins also allows ISIL to wipe the slate clean and to start afresh, leaving no traces of any previous culture or civilization, while also providing an ideal platform for the group to establish its own identity and leave its mark on history. Despite the images showing extreme destruction, ISIL has also been making use of the looted antiquities to finance their activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/15/iraq-isis-arrest-jihadists-wealth-power |title=How an arrest in Iraq revealed Isis's $2bn jihadist network |author=Martin Chulov |work=The Guardian |access-date=2016-12-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140616091317/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/15/iraq-isis-arrest-jihadists-wealth-power |archive-date=2014-06-16 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the UN's ban on the trade of artifacts looted from Syria since 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/02/12/us-mideast-crisis-un-idUSKBN0LG1YN20150212 |title=U.N.

===Mosques and shrines===
In 2014, media reported destruction of multiple, Sunni and [[Shiite]], mosques and shrines throughout areas captured by ISIL.&lt;ref name="hp"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/07/07/isis-destroys-shiite-mosque_n_5564373.html |title=ISIS Destroys Shiite Mosques And Shrines In Iraq, Dangerously Fracturing Country (PHOTOS) |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |date=7 July 2014 |accessdate=27 February 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150225113446/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/07/07/isis-destroys-shiite-mosque_n_5564373.html |archive-date=25 February 2015 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among them were the Al-Qubba Husseiniya Mosque in [[Mosul]], [[Sheikh Jawad Al-Sadiq Mosque]], [[Mosque of Arnā’ūt]], [[Mosque of Qado]], [[Mosque of Askar e- Mullah]] and [[Saad Ibn Aqeel Shrine|Saad Bin Aqeel Shrine]] in [[Tal Afar]], [[Sufism|Sufi]] Ahmed al-Rifai Shrine and tomb and Sheikh Ibrahim shrine in Mahlabiya District and the so-called Tomb of the Girl (Qabr al-Bint) in Mosul.&lt;ref name="hp"/&gt; The Tomb of the Girl, reputed to honour a girl who died of a broken heart, was actually believed to be the tomb of medieval scholar [[Ali ibn al-Athir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/world/isis-insurgents-wage-war-on-history/article6158435.ece |title=ISIS insurgents wage war on history |work=[[The Hindu]] |author=Praveen Swami |date=29 June 2014 |accessdate=27 February 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140708210920/http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/world/isis-insurgents-wage-war-on-history/article6158435.ece |archive-date=8 July 2014 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2014, ISIL bulldozed the two buildings in the complex of the shrine of [[Fathi al-Ka'en]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.presstv.ir/detail/2014/06/25/368591/isil-destroys-two-shia-sites-in-mosul |title=ISIL destroys two Shia religious sites in Iraqi city of Mosul |publisher=PressTV |date=25 June 2014 |accessdate=28 February 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402103926/http://www.presstv.ir/detail/2014/06/25/368591/isil-destroys-two-shia-sites-in-mosul/ |archive-date=2 April 2015 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Mosul, ISIL also targeted several tombs with shrines built over them.

On 25 July 2014, the 13th-century shrine of [[Imam Awn al-Din]] in Mosul, one of the few structures to have survived the [[Mongol invasions and conquests#West Asia|13th-century Mongol invasion]], was destroyed by ISIL.{{cn|date=March 2019}} The destruction was mostly carried out with explosive devices, but in some cases bulldozers were used.&lt;ref name="hp"/&gt;

In March 2015, ISIL reportedly bulldozed to the ground the Hamu Al-Qadu Mosque in Mosul, dating back to 1880. The Hamu-Al-Qadu mosque contained an earlier tomb of [[Ala-al-din Ibn Abdul Qadir Gilani]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sputniknews.com/middleeast/20150308/1019218229.html |title=ISIL Destroys Another Mosque in Iraq |publisher=[[Sputnik (news agency)|Sputnik]] |date=8 March 2015 |accessdate=10 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402145225/http://sputniknews.com/middleeast/20150308/1019218229.html |archive-date=2 April 2015 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year ISIL ordered the removal of all decorative elements and frescoes from mosques in Mosul, even those containing [[Quranic]] verses that mention Allah.&lt;ref name="tass"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tass.ru/mezhdunarodnaya-panorama/1876232 |title="Исламское государство" заставило имамов Мосула удалять фрески со стен мечетей |publisher=[[Russian News Agency "TASS"]] |language=Russian |date=2 April 2015 |accessdate=22 May 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150408092356/http://tass.ru/mezhdunarodnaya-panorama/1876232 |archive-date=8 April 2015 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; They were regarded by ISIL as "an erroneous form of creativity, contradicting the basics of [[sharia]]." At least one [[imam]] in Mosul opposing that order was shot to death.&lt;ref name="tass"/&gt;

ISIL also destroyed [[Sufism|Sufi]] shrines near [[Tripoli]], [[Libya]], in March 2015. The shrines were destroyed by sledgehammers and bulldozers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Thornhill |first1=Ted |title=ISIS continues its desecration of the Middle East: Islamic State reduces Sufi shrines in Libya to rubble in latest act of mindless destruction |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2987800/ISIS-continues-desecration-Middle-East-Islamic-State-reduces-Sufi-shrines-Libya-rubble-latest-act-mindless-destruction.html |accessdate=12 March 2015 |work=Daily Mail |date=10 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150312061227/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2987800/ISIS-continues-desecration-Middle-East-Islamic-State-reduces-Sufi-shrines-Libya-rubble-latest-act-mindless-destruction.html |archive-date=12 March 2015 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Tadmur offensive (2015)|capture of Palmyra]] in Syria, ISIL was reported as not intending to demolish the city's World Heritage Site (while still intending to destroy any statues deemed '[[Polytheism|polytheistic]]').&lt;ref name="theguardian"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/27/isis-releases-footage-of-palmyra-ruins-intact |title=Syria: Isis releases footage of Palmyra ruins intact and 'will not destroy them' |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=29 May 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150527210450/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/27/isis-releases-footage-of-palmyra-ruins-intact |archive-date=27 May 2015 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 May 2015, ISIL released an 87-second video showing parts of the apparently undamaged ancient [[colonnade]]s, the [[Temple of Bel]] and the [[Roman Theatre at Palmyra|Roman theatre]].&lt;ref name="theguardian"/&gt; On 27 June 2015, however, ISIL demolished the ancient [[Lion of Al-lāt]] statue in Palmyra.

The general director of the [[National Museum (Prague)|Czech National Museum]], Michal Lukeš, signed an agreement in June 2017 committing the institution to help Syria save, preserve and conserve much of its cultural and historical heritage damaged by war, including the ancient site of Palmyra; he met with Maamoun Abdulkarim and discussed plans for the works that are said to last until 2019.&lt;ref name=czradio&gt;{{cite news |last1=Johnstone |first1=Chris |title=Czechs sign up to help save Syrian cultural heritage |url=http://www.radio.cz/en/section/panorama/czechs-sign-up-to-help-save-syrian-cultural-heritage |accessdate=24 June 2017 |work=Radio Praha |date=17 May 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170523052039/http://www.radio.cz/en/section/panorama/czechs-sign-up-to-help-save-syrian-cultural-heritage |archive-date=23 May 2017 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2017, The World Monuments Fund (WMF) announced launching a £500,000 scheme to train Syrian refugees near the Syrian-Jordanian border in traditional stone masonry. The aim is teaching them to develop skills necessary to be able to help in restoring cultural heritage sites that have been damaged or destroyed during the Syrian Civil War once peace is restored to Syria.&lt;ref name=theart&gt;{{cite news |last1=Shaw |first1=Anny |title=Syrian refugees to be trained to rebuild Palmyra and other heritage sites |url=http://theartnewspaper.com/news/news/syrian-refugees-to-be-trained-in-traditional-stone-masonry-to-rebuild-palmyra-and-other-heritage-sit/ |accessdate=24 June 2017 |work=The Art Newspaper |date=21 June 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170624090053/http://theartnewspaper.com/news/news/syrian-refugees-to-be-trained-in-traditional-stone-masonry-to-rebuild-palmyra-and-other-heritage-sit/ |archive-date=2017-06-24 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===October 2015 - Saada airstrike===
Doctors Without Borders reported that a Saudi Arabian-led [[Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen|coalition]] airstrike on 26 October 2015&lt;ref name="urlExposed: British-made bombs used on civilian targets in Yemen | Amnesty International UK"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amnesty.org.uk/exposed-british-made-bombs-used-civilian-targets-yemen |title=Exposed: British-made bombs used on civilian targets in Yemen &amp;#124; Amnesty International UK |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; had completely destroyed the [[Médecins Sans Frontières]] hospital in [[Saada]], in northwestern [[Yemen]], including the operating room.  The first strike hit an unused part of the hospital, so the facility was completely evacuated at once.  There were no direct casualties. The spokesman for the [[coalition forces]], Brig-Gen [[Ahmad Asiri (general)|Ahmed al-Asiri]], disclaimed responsibility for the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-34645469|title=Yemen conflict: MSF hospital destroyed by air strikes|date=27 October 2015|publisher=|accessdate=3 February 2017|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"With the hospital destroyed, at least 200,000 people now have no access to lifesaving medical care", MSF said.  "This attack is another illustration of a complete disregard for civilians in Yemen, where bombings have become a daily routine," said Hassan Boucenine, MSF head of mission in Yemen.  The GPS coordinates of the only hospital in the Haydan district were regularly shared with the Saudi-led coalition, and the roof of the facility was clearly identified with the MSF logo, he said.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2015-10/28/c_134756413.htm "MSF hospital in Yemen bombed by airstrike", ''Xinhua'' (2015-10-28)]&lt;/ref&gt; Abdallah al-Mouallimi, the Saudi ambassador to the United Nations, said the coordinates were inaccurate, although he admitted that the airstrike was "a mistake".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.vice.com/article/exclusive-saudi-arabia-admits-bombing-msf-hospital-in-yemen-but-faults-msf|title=Exclusive: Saudi Arabia Admits Bombing MSF Hospital in Yemen — But Faults MSF - VICE News|publisher=|accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UNICEF said the hospital in Saada was the 39th health center hit in Yemen since March, when the violence escalated. MSF reports that the Saudi-led coalition, supported by the British military, has been bombing hospitals across Yemen for the past 10 months. As many as 130 health facilities have been hit. "More children in Yemen may well die from a lack of medicines and healthcare than from bullets and bombs," its executive director Anthony Lake said in a statement.  He added that critical shortages of fuel, medication, electricity and water could mean many more will close. [[Amnesty International]] said the strike may amount to a war crime and called for an independent investigation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/10/27/us-yemen-security-idUSKCN0SL0VK20151027 Noah Browning, "Yemeni MSF hospital bombed, Saudi-led coalition denies responsibility", ''Reuters'' (October 27 2015)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/world/2015/10/28/doctors-without-borders-says-saudi-led-airstrikes-bomb-yemen-hospital/ "Doctors Without Borders says Saudi-led airstrikes bomb Yemen hospital", ''Associated Press'' (October 28, 2015)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===December 2015 - Taiz airstrike===
On December 3, 2015 an airstrike by the [[Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen]] hit a health center in [[Taiz]], wounding nine people. Two hospital staff were among the wounded.  "The bombing of civilians and hospitals is a violation of international humanitarian law," said Jerome Alin, head of MSF head of mission in Yemen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/article/yemen-nine-wounded-saudi-led-coalition-airstrike-msf-clinic-taiz|title=Yemen: Nine Wounded in Saudi-Led Coalition Airstrike on MSF Clinic in Taiz|date=3 December 2015|publisher=|accessdate=3 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170130124244/http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/article/yemen-nine-wounded-saudi-led-coalition-airstrike-msf-clinic-taiz|archive-date=30 January 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/article/msf-supported-hospital-bombed-northern-yemen  "MSF-Supported Hospital Bombed in Northern Yemen", MSF (Update January 11 2016)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201064940/http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/article/msf-supported-hospital-bombed-northern-yemen |date=2016-02-01 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===January 2016 - Razeh district airstrike===
On January 10, 2016, Shiara Hospital, supported by MSF in Razeh district, [[Saada Governorate]], Northern Yemen, was hit by a projectile and shrapnel from the Saudi-led coalition.  Six people died and another 7 were injured, including three MSF staff, two of them in critical condition. Several buildings at the medical facility collapsed after the attack,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/11/world/middleeast/hospital-aided-by-doctors-without-borders-is-bombed-in-yemen.html|title=Hospital Aided by Doctors Without Borders Is Bombed in Yemen|date=11 January 2016|work=The New York Times|accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark Tran, "Four patients among dead after explosion at hospital in Yemen", The Guardian (January 10, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adam Withnall, "Attacks on hospitals mean people in Yemen are now too scared to go for treatment, MSF says", The Independent (January 19, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; although the critical areas of the hospital were not destroyed.  The rocket hit a corridor leading from the main gate to the hospital buildings, with a metal fence alongside. The wounded were hit by shrapnel from the missile, and also by shards of metal from the fence. The injuries were brutal. Vickie Hawkins, Executive Director of MSF-UK, said, "... there is a risk that "errors" in war situations will become normalised—just as "collateral damage" has been normalised in people's minds since the first Gulf War. This would provide the perfect alibi for armies to shrug off accusations of war crimes and crimes against humanity. It perpetuates impunity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/article/yemen-even-war-hospitals-should-be-places-refuge-and-healing|title=Yemen: Even in War, Hospitals Should Be "Places of Refuge And Healing"|date=19 January 2016|publisher=|accessdate=3 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170130124235/http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/article/yemen-even-war-hospitals-should-be-places-refuge-and-healing|archive-date=30 January 2017|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===August 2016 - Abs district hospital airstrike===
On August 15, 2016, after the collapse of a UN-sponsored cease-fire, an airstrike by the [[Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen]] destroyed a hospital operated by Yemen's Ministry of Health and supported by MSF and UNICEF in [[Abs District]], [[Hajjah Governorate]] in northwestern Yemen.

[[File:Blason Hagenbach.svg|thumb|150px|right|[[Coat of arms]] of Hagenbach]]
'''Peter von Hagenbach''' (or Pierre de Hagenbach or Pietro di Hagenbach or Pierre d’Archambaud or Pierre d'Aquenbacq, circa 1420&amp;nbsp;– May 9, 1474) was a [[Bourguignons|Bourguignon]] knight from [[Alsace]] and Germanic military and civil commander.

He was born into an [[Alsace|Alsatian]]-[[Bourgogne|Burgundian]] family, originally from [[Hagenbach, Haut-Rhin|Hagenbach]] and owned a castle there.

He was instated as [[Landvogt|bailiff of Upper Alsace]] by [[Charles the Bold]], [[Duke of Burgundy]], to administer the territories and rights on the [[Upper Rhine]] which had been mortgaged by [[Sigmund of Habsburg|Duke Sigmund of Further Austria]] for 50,000 [[Florin (Italian coin)|florins]] in the {{Interlanguage link multi|Treaty of St. Omer|fr|3=Traité de Saint-Omer}} in 1469. There he coined the term ''[[Landsknecht]]''{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}—from [[German language|German]], ''Land'' ("land, country") + ''Knecht'' ("servant").

It was originally intended to indicate soldiers of the [[Swabia|lowlands]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] as opposed to the [[Swiss mercenaries]]. As early as 1500 the [[Folk etymology|misleading spelling]] "''Lanzknecht''" became common because of the phonetic and visual similarity between ''Land''(''e'')''s'' ("of the land/territory") and ''Lanze'' ("[[lance]]").

Following a [[Burgundian Wars|rebellion]] by towns of the Upper Rhine against his tyranny, Hagenbach was put on trial for the atrocities committed during the occupation of [[Breisach]], found guilty of [[war crimes]], and [[Decapitation|beheaded]]&lt;ref name="Schabas"&gt;[http://assets.cambridge.org/97805218/81258/excerpt/9780521881258_excerpt.pdf An Introduction to the International Criminal Court] William A.

[[File:El Libertador Simón Bolívar, Firmando el Decreto de GUERRA A MUERTE contra los Españoles.jpg|thumb|324x324px|[[Simón Bolívar]] signs the Decree of War to the Death in 1813, during his [[Admirable Campaign]].]]
The '''Decree of War to the Death''', in Spanish '''''Decreto de Guerra a Muerte''''', was a decree issued by the South American leader [[Simón Bolívar]] which permitted murder and any atrocities whatsoever to be committed against civilians born in [[Spain]], other than those actively assisting South American independence, and furthermore exonerated Latin Americans who had already committed such murders and atrocities. The phrase "war to the death" was used as a [[euphemism]] for these atrocities.

The decree was an explicit "[[war of extermination]]" in Bolívar's attempt to maintain Venezuelan independence in the war with Spain, since he felt that the [[Spanish Army]]'s use of atrocities against those who supported the [[First Republic of Venezuela]] had contributed decisively to its defeat.&lt;ref name=Arana&gt;Arana, M. (2013). ''Bolivar''. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, {{ISBN|9781439110195}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|142-143}}

Bolívar promulgated the decree on June 15, 1813, in the Venezuelan city of [[Trujillo, Trujillo|Trujillo]].

==Background==
The decree states that it was created as a response to severe crimes and massacres by [[Spain|Spanish]] soldiers after the fall of the First Republic, in which Spanish leaders allegedly stole property and executed thousands of Republicans: "we could not indifferently watch the afflictions inflicted to you by the barbaric Spaniards, who have annihilated you with robbery and destroyed you with death, infringed the most solemn treaties and capitulations [a reference to the San Mateo Capitulation, 1812]; in one word, committed every crime, reducing the Republic of Venezuela to the most horrific desolation." It proclaimed that all [[Peninsulares|Peninsular people]] in Spanish America who didn't actively participate in favor of its independence would be killed, and all South Americans would be spared, even if they had cooperated with the Spanish authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Stoan, ''Pablo Morillo'', 47-50.&lt;/ref&gt; (See below for full declaration). The document's ultimate goal was to assure the Venezuelan elites that they would not be unfavorably treated for having collaborated with [[Juan Domingo de Monteverde|Domingo de Monteverde]] and the royalist authorities. The Decree was the first step in transforming the common and legal view of the Venezuelan war of liberation from a mere [[Insurgency|rebellion]] (or at best a [[civil war]]) taking place in one of [[Spain]]'s [[colony|colonies]], to a full-fledged international [[war]] between two distinct [[country|countries]], Venezuela and Spain.

==Practice of the "''Guerra a Muerte''"==
This so-called ''Guerra a Muerte'' was widely practised on both sides, resulting in some extreme brutalities on both sides, such as the execution of Spanish prisoners in [[Caracas]] and [[La Guaira]] in February 1814, on orders from Bolívar himself, just before the collapse of the [[Second Republic of Venezuela]], and the killing of several renowned citizens in [[United Provinces of New Granada|New Granada]] by the royalist army under [[Pablo Morillo]] in 1815, 1816 and 1817.

The declaration remained in effect until November 26, 1820, when General [[Pablo Morillo]] met with Bolívar at [[Santa Ana de Trujillo]] to declare the war of independence a conventional war.

== Text of the Decree ==
{{Copy section to Wikisource}}
Note: The term "Americans" here means natives of the American continent.

"''Venezuelans: an army of brothers, sent by the sovereign [[Congress]] of [[United Provinces of New Granada|New Granada]], has come to free you, and it is already amongst you, after evicting the oppressors from the provinces of [[Mérida (state)|Mérida]] and [[Trujillo (state)|Trujillo]].

''We are the ones sent to destroy the [[Peninsulares|Spaniards]], to protect the Americans, and to reestablish the [[republic]]an governments that formed the [[Confederation]] of [[First Republic of Venezuela|Venezuela]]. The states covering our arms (weapons) are once again ruled by their old [[constitution]]s and [[magistrate]]s, fully enjoying their liberty and independence; for our mission is only to break the chains of servitude, which still oppress some of our peoples, not claiming to create laws, or enforce acts of domination, which the right of war could authorize us to do.

''Touched by your misfortunes, we could not indifferently watch the afflictions inflicted to you by the barbaric Spaniards, who have annihilated you with robbery and destroyed you with death, infringed the most solemn treaties and capitulations; in one word, committed every crime, reducing the Republic of Venezuela to the most horrific desolation. It is so that justice demands vindication, and necessity forces us to take it. May the monsters that infest [[Americas|Colombian]] soil, and have covered it with blood disappear for good; may their punishment be equal to the magnitude of their treason, so that the stain of our [[shame|ignominy]] is washed off, and to show the nations of the universe that the sons of America cannot be offended without punishment.

''In spite of our just resentments against the iniquitous Spaniards, our magnanimity still deigns itself to open, for the last time, a route to conciliation and friendship; we still invite them to live peacefully among us, if, hating their crimes and turning to good faith, they cooperate with us in the destruction of the intruding government of Spain, and the reestablishment of the Republic of Venezuela.

''All Spaniards who do not conspire against tyranny in favor of our just cause, using the most effective and active resources, will be considered enemies, and will be punished as traitors to the homeland, and therefore, will be promptly executed. On the other hand, a general and absolute pardon is issued to all Spaniards who pass into our army, with or without their weapons; to those who offer aid to the good citizens working hard to shake off the shackles of tyranny. War officers and magistrates that proclaim the government of Venezuela and join our cause will keep their destinies and work positions; in one word, all Spaniards who perform service for the State will be reputed and treated as Americans.

''And you, Americans, who have been separated from the road of justice by error and perfidy, know that your brothers forgive you and seriously regret your misdeeds, intimately persuaded that you cannot be guilty, and that only the ignorance and blindness imposed on you by the authors of your crimes could cause you to perpetrate them. Do not fear the sword that comes to avenge you and cut the ignominious bindings which tie you to your executioners' fate. Rely on absolute immunity for your honor, life and properties; the mere title of Americans will be you warranty and safeguard. Our weapons have come to protect you, and will never be used against a single one of our brothers.

''This amnesty extends to the very traitors who have most recently committed their acts of [[felony]]; and will be so religiously carried out that no reason, cause or pretext will be enough to make us break our offer, no matter how extraordinary the reasons you give us to excite our adversity.

''Spaniards and Canarians, count on death, even if indifferent, if you do not actively work in favor of the independence of America. Americans, count on life, even if guilty.''"

Once it was the largest company in Europe, and one of largest [[World War II|wartime]] users of [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|slave labor]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}} in [[Nazi Germany]], including the Krupp munitions factory (''Weichsel Union Metallwerke'') in the [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz death camp]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hist-chron.com/judentum-aktenlage/hol/Pressac_auschwitz-original-fotos-bauten-d/012-waffenfabrik-Krupp.jpg Index of /judentum-aktenlage]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959, the company promised to pay individual compensations of DM5,000 ($1,190) to 2,000 slave workers (or 2% of all the estimated estimated 100,000 slave workers), or DM10,000,000 ($2,380,000) in total.&lt;ref&gt;Theodore Shabad. 1959.

On the death of Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach in 1967,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.krupp-stiftung.de/historie/|title=Historie - Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach-Stiftung|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the entire holdings of the Krupp family were transferred to the foundation. Today, the foundation is the largest shareholder of the [[ThyssenKrupp]] industrial conglomerate (20.9% as of 2018) and largely controls the board of the company. The foundation is also tasked with preserving the “unity” of ThyssenKrupp and uses proceeds from ThyssenKrupp’s dividend payments to further good causes in science and education.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Kaeckenhoff, Arno Schuetze and Edward Taylor (July 17, 2018), [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-thyssenkrupp-chairman-investors-expla/thyssenkrupps-foundation-to-steer-conglomerate-in-leadership-crisis-idUSKBN1K71VN Thyssenkrupp's foundation to steer conglomerate in leadership crisis] ''[[Reuters]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2018 money, the aforementioned 1959 compensation payouts equate to $20,537,000, that is, €18,401,000.

== Attack ==
According to [[Save the Children]], at the time of the attack the children were on a bus heading back to school from a picnic when the driver stopped to get refreshment at the market in Dahyan.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Most of the children were under age 10, according to the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; A Red Cross–supported hospital in [[Sa'dah|Saada]] received the bodies of 29 children under 15 years of age and 48 wounded individuals, 30 of whom were children.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/saudi-arabia-airstrike-yemen-kids-killed-bus-dahyan-market-saada-icrc-says/|title=Saudi coalition airstrike in Yemen kills 50, rebels say|access-date=2018-08-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A total of 40 children were killed in the strike.&lt;ref&gt;https://edition.cnn.com/2018/08/17/middleeast/us-saudi-yemen-bus-strike-intl/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a resident of Dahyan, the warplanes had been loitering over the area for more than an hour before they attacked.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/dozens-children-killed-and-injured-airstrike-yemen-bus-red-cross-says-61507076|title=At least 29 children killed by Saudi-led air strike on Yemeni school bus|work=Middle East Eye|access-date=2018-08-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another witness said, "Our shops were open and shoppers were walking around as usual.

The bomb that killed the children was a 227 kg (500 lb) laser-guided [[Mark 82 bomb|Mk 82 bomb]] made by [[Lockheed Martin]]. It had been supplied by the [[United States]] to [[Saudi Arabia]].&lt;ref name=CNN17/&gt;

== Media coverage ==
The attack came to light after videos were posted on [[Twitter]] depicting the remains of the bus and the children.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Images of the victims were aired on the [[Almasirah|Al Masirah TV]] network, highlighting dramatic images of blood and debris-covered children lying on hospital stretchers.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The Saudi Arabian coalition later issued a statement saying that they conducted an airstrike in Saada but were targeting [[Houthi]] missile launchers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The mass funeral of the children was aired on the Al Mariah TV network, with thousands of Yemenis participating.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2018/08/14/protests-at-funeral-for-yemeni-children-killed-in-coalition-strike.html|title=Protests at funeral for Yemeni children killed in coalition strike|last=Post|first=The Jakarta|work=The Jakarta Post|access-date=2018-08-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reactions ==

=== Domestic ===
The official Saudi Arabian press agency called the strike a "legitimate military action" which targeted those who were responsible for a rebel missile attack on the Saudi Arabian city of [[Jizan]] on Wednesday.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/09/world/middleeast/yemen-airstrike-school-bus-children.html|title=Saudi Coalition Bombs School Bus in Yemen, Killing Dozens|access-date=10 August 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also claimed that the airstrikes "conformed to international and humanitarian laws"&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; and that [[Houthis]] were using children as human shields.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Yemeni journalist Nasser Arrabyee reported that there were no Houthis in the vicinity of the strike.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A Houthi spokesman said that the coalition showed "clear disregard for civilian life", as the attack had targeted a crowded public place in the city.&lt;ref name="Reuters 9082018" /&gt; During the mass funeral of the children, many signs were visible protesting against the United States, Saudi Arabia, and Israel.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

On 1 September 2018, the Saudi Arabian-led coalition admitted mistakes, expressing regrets and pledged to hold those responsible for the strikes accountable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-45382561|title='Mistakes' admitted in Yemen bus attack|date=2018-09-01|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-09-02|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;
